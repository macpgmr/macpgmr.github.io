<A HREF="WebAppOverview_2.html">Part 2</A> showed how to customize a "canned"
Web app (QxMap) via simple JSON files deployed with the app. But QxMap can
also be customized by passing data as part of the URL query string.<P>

For example, the embedded app below shows the elevation of several locations, 
where the location and elevation data was passed in the query string, overriding
the data in the app's locations.json file. To see the query string, look at this
page's HTML source or click 
<A HREF='../iApps/qxmap/index.html?locations=[{"name":"Ouray","lat":38.02,"lon":-107.67,"display":"7,792 feet"},{"name":"Silverton","lat":37.81,"lon":-107.66,"display":"9,308 feet"},{"name":"Telluride","lat":37.94,"lon":-107.81,"display":"8,750 feet"}]' TARGET='_blank'>here</A>
to launch the app in its own browser window.<P>

<EMBED SRC='../iApps/qxmap/index.html?locations=[{"name":"Ouray","lat":38.02,"lon":-107.67,"display":"7,792 feet"},{"name":"Silverton","lat":37.81,"lon":-107.66,"display":"9,308 feet"},{"name":"Telluride","lat":37.94,"lon":-107.81,"display":"8,750 feet"}]' TYPE="text/html" WIDTH=800 HEIGHT=500><P>

Here's a list of what can be overridden in the URL query string:<P>
<UL>
  <LI>locations
  <LI>mapCenterLon
  <LI>mapCenterLat
  <LI>mapZoomLevel
</UL>

All well and good, but what about using this app somewhere other
than a standalone browser, for example in something written in Pascal?<P>

Well, if all you need to do is view the Web app with data supplied by your 
desktop app, simply launching an external browser and letting it load and
run the Web app might be sufficient. For example, in Lazarus you could do 
something like this:<P>

<pre><code class="pascal">procedure TForm1.Button1Click(Sender: TObject);
var
  Url : string;
begin
  Url := 'https://macpgmr.github.io/iApps/qxmap/index.html?locations=' +
         '[{"name":"Ouray","lat":38.02,"lon":-107.67,"display":"7,792 feet"},' +
         '{"name":"Silverton","lat":37.81,"lon":-107.66,"display":"9,308 feet"},' +
         '{"name":"Telluride","lat":37.94,"lon":-107.81,"display":"8,750 feet"}]';
{$IFDEF DARWIN}
  fpSystem('open ''' + Url + '''');
{$ELSE}
  Url := StringReplace(Url, '"', '%22', [rfReplaceAll]);
  OpenURL(Url);
{$ENDIF}
end;</code></pre>

Once launched like this, the Web app is independent of your desktop app,
meaning you can launch more than one instance if you want. When done with
the Web app, the user just closes the browser tab. In this example,
the browser functions much like a non-modal report viewer.<P>

This should also be easy, but since Lazarus lacks a cross-platform Web browser
control, you'll need to come up with your own solution, possibly a 
platform-specific one.<P>

For example, here's a screenshot of Xcode with the <B>ObjPMap</B> project loaded.
Since ObjPMap is an Objective Pascal app, it can use any Objective C class,
so it uses the Cocoa WebView control as an embedded browser to load and run
QxMap.<P>

<IMG src="WebAppOverview_3_XcodeObjPMap.jpg" hspace="10" border="1" alt="[Image] goes here"><P>

To try out ObjPMap, you have two options:<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Download the ObjPMap source from <A HREF="objpmap_src.zip">here</A> and unzip it, then
      open ObjPMap.xcodeproj in Xcode and choose Product | Run.<P>
  <LI>Download ObjPMap.dmg from here: <A HREF="ObjPMap.dmg">ObjPMap.dmg</A><BR>
      This .dmg has not been codesigned, so right-click on ObjPMap.dmg and 
      choose Open rather than double-clicking it.
</UL>

You can also browse the view controller code to see how easy it is to use
a WebView control with Pascal and Xcode:

Notes on ObjPMap:<P>

<OL>
  <LI>ObjPMap was created using the osx-simple template included with
      <A HREF="../ObjP/ProjectXC.html">ProjectXC</A>.<P>
  <LI>Several of the default menus that the template adds to a new app are not 
      relevant to a simple app like ObjPMap. However, these menus have been 
      left alone in case someone wants to extend ObjPMap, for example, to support 
      loading a file containing locations and lat/lon coordinates rather than 
      just using the app's hard-wired locations.
