<H2>Part 8: Making Your Lazarus App Mac-Friendly</H2>

Lazarus is a versatile and extensible tool, but its Delphi-influenced 
heritage does not match up well with the needs of Mac applications, particularly
in the user interface department. And since you won't be using Apple's Xcode 
IDE at all when developing a Lazarus app on Mac, you'll need to do a number of 
things manually and outside of the Lazarus IDE.<p>

If you simply recompile a Lazarus or converted Delphi app with Lazarus on Mac, 
you'll end up with a vaguely Win95 look and feel that would likely fall short of
the user interface guidelines of Apple's new Mac App Store. However, with a few 
conditionally compiled code additions, you can get your app to act 
a lot more like a standard Mac app.<p>

Here are some problem areas that this article attempts to address:<p>

Note that this article assumes that you're compiling with the Carbon widgetset
using Lazarus 0.9.29 or later. However, much of this article will also apply
to any future Cocoa-based widgetset. Some parts should even be applicable
to non-LCL Pascal Cocoa development.<p>

Also, I've created several small convenience units and added them to the 
<b>XDev Toolkit</b> (a miscellaneous collection of stuff I've developed over 
the years). The <b>CFHelpers</b> unit has routines that make it easier to work 
with OS X Core Foundation (CF) strings in Pascal. The <b>PropListUtil</b> 
unit makes working with property list files easier and the <b>PrefsUtil</b>
unit makes reading and writing application preferences easier. The XDev Toolkit 
is here:<p>

<A name="AppMenu"></A><H3>Application menu</H3>

All Mac apps have an "application" menu between the Apple menu
and the app's File menu on the menu bar at the top of the screen.
The name of the app menu is the same as your app's name and is obtained from
your app's bundle name (more below on that).<p>

When you compile an app on Mac with Lazarus, you automatically get the app 
menu without doing anything yourself, but this default app menu lacks
two menu items that typically appear in different menus on other 
platforms, namely the About and Preferences items. Fortunately it's easy 
to add these yourself conditionally.<p>

First, you'll need to add something like this to your main form's
declaration:<p>

<pre>
{$IFDEF DARWIN}
  AppMenu     : TMenuItem;
  AppAboutCmd : TMenuItem;
  AppSep1Cmd  : TMenuItem;
  AppPrefCmd  : TMenuItem;
{$ENDIF}
</pre>

Now add this in the main form's FormCreate handler or some other startup code:
<pre>
{$IFDEF DARWIN}
  AppMenu := TMenuItem.Create(Self);  {Application menu}
  AppMenu.Caption := #$EF#$A3#$BF;  {Unicode Apple logo char}
  MainMenu.Items.Insert(0, AppMenu);

  AppAboutCmd := TMenuItem.Create(Self);
  AppAboutCmd.Caption := 'About ' + BundleName;  //&lt;== BundleName set elsewhere
  AppAboutCmd.OnClick := AboutCmdClick;
  AppMenu.Add(AppAboutCmd);  {Add About as item in application menu}
  
  AppSep1Cmd := TMenuItem.Create(Self);
  AppSep1Cmd.Caption := '-';
  AppMenu.Add(AppSep1Cmd);

  AppPrefCmd := TMenuItem.Create(Self);
  AppPrefCmd.Caption := 'Preferences...';
  AppPrefCmd.Shortcut := ShortCut(VK_OEM_COMMA, [ssMeta]);
  AppPrefCmd.OnClick := OptionsCmdClick;  //&lt;== "Options" on other platforms
  AppMenu.Add(AppPrefCmd);
{$ENDIF}
</pre>

Note that the app menu already has a Quit command, so you'll
want to delete (conditionally) any Quit or Exit command from your File menu,
as well as remove About and Preferences commands if they appear elsewhere
in the main menu (in which case you can just reuse them here instead of
creating them again).<p>


<A name="Buttons"></A><H3>Button size and position</H3>

In the physical world, push buttons are probably more likely these days to
have a rounded shape than the rectangular shape of buttons on Windows
(and by transference, Linux). Mac push buttons reflect this and have an oval 
shape. But with the Lazarus Carbon widgetset, if a button is greater than 22 
pixels high (Height property), it's drawn as a rectangle, so make sure you 
limit button height in the Lazarus form designer to 22 or less (TButton, 
TBitBtn).<p>

That works fine if you're targeting only Mac, but what if you have a cross-platform
app and you're perfectly happy with the "square" (old fashioned) look on Windows 
and Linux and want oval buttons only on Mac? Unfortunately, Lazarus form 
design files (.lfm), like Delphi's form design files (.dfm), don't support 
any kind of conditional property values. So what to do?<p>

One solution would be to have two sets of form files, but this seems like
overkill if all you want is oval buttons, although it does allow you then
to modify anything else in the form (useful elsewhere as we'll see later).<p>

Another approach is to use a utility like the XDev Toolkit's DfmToLfm converter
to reduce button height automatically in form files that you're converting
from Delphi.<p>

A third possibility would be to reduce button height at runtime, using 
conditional code.<p>

On a Mac dialog with a Cancel button, the Cancel button is positioned to the
left of the "action" button (OK, Save, etc.). This is opposite the usual way 
that buttons are positioned on Windows. Again, what to do?<p>

If you don't want two sets of form files, you could do something like this
to avoid sprinkling conditional code throughout your form Pascal files:

<pre>
procedure TMainForm.CheckOKCancelBtns(OKBtn     : TControl;
                                      CancelBtn : TControl);
 {Swap OK and Cancel button positions on Mac.}
{$IFDEF DARWIN}
var
  SaveLeft : Integer;
begin
  if OKBtn.Left &lt; CancelBtn.Left then
    begin
    SaveLeft := OKBtn.Left;
    OKBtn.Left := CancelBtn.Left;
    CancelBtn.Left := SaveLeft;
    end;
{$ELSE}  {Do nothing}
begin
{$ENDIF}
end;  {TMainForm.CheckOKCancelBtns}
</pre>

Now each place where you invoke a dialog box, add a single line of code
(which is basically a no-op on other platforms):

<pre>
  SomeDlg := TSomeDlg.Create(Application);
  try
    CheckOKCancelBtns(SomeDlg.OKButton, SomeDlg.CancelButton);
    if ShowDlg.ShowModal &lt;&gt; mrOK then
      Exit;
    ...
  finally
    SomeDlg.Free;
    end;
  end;
</pre>

While improper button position is one thing that will really flag your app
as a port from an alien platform, there are other important button 
differences as well. For example, Mac buttons normally appear at the bottom 
right of the dialog. For more information, refer to Apple's Human Interface 
Guidelines (HIG):<p>

<A HREF="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/XHIGIntro/XHIGIntro.html">Apple Human Interface Guidelines</a>


<A name="Dialogs"></A><H3>Dialog boxes and modal sheets</H3>

Mac apps tend to use fewer modal dialogs than apps on Windows. For example,
the About and Preferences dialogs in most Mac apps are modeless. They also
lack an OK or Close or Cancel button, relying instead on the title bar's close 
button to dismiss the dialog. This means that changes in preferences that
affect the app's look (for example, colors) tend to go into effect as soon 
as they're made, rather than after the dialog is closed.<p>

When a Mac app does need a user response before it can proceed, it normally 
uses a modal "sheet", not a modal dialog. A modal sheet does not  
block access to the rest of the application the way a modal dialog does. It also 
has a different look, "descending" from the main window's title bar as though 
pulled down ("unfurl" is Apple's term), rather than popping up like a dialog.
A sheet is "document modal" rather than "application modal".<p>

Unfortunately, sheets are an alien concept to Delphi VCL and thus
Lazarus LCL, so you won't be able to use them in your Lazarus apps. And you
will probably never be able to use them, even in a future Cocoa-based Lazarus,
unless a sea change occurs in the LCL and support is added for sheets.
If you're developing in Pascal with Cocoa but not using the LCL, then of course 
you can (and should) use sheets, but with the LCL this feature will 
probably remain out of reach. Part of the reason is that when a sheet is 
run, the app doesn't wait around until the sheet is closed the way it does when
ShowModal is called. Instead, when the sheet ends, its delegate 
object is called and that object handles the sheet's results. This requires
a different program structure than modal dialogs (calling code handles results)
or modeless dialogs (dialog handles close event).<p>

To display a dialog modelessly while retaining its modal behavior on
Windows, you can do something conditionally like this:<p>

<pre>
{$IFDEF DARWIN}
  if Assigned(AboutBox) then  {Already displayed?}
    Exit;
  AboutBox := TAboutBox.Create(Application);
  AboutBox.OKButton.Visible := False;
  AboutBox.Show;
{$ELSE}
  AboutBox := TAboutBox.Create(Application);
  try
    AboutBox.ShowModal;
  finally
    AboutBox.Free;
    end;
{$ENDIF}
</pre>

Be sure to add an OnClose handler to your dialog like this:<p>

<pre>
procedure TAboutBox.FormClose(    Sender: TObject; 
                              var Action: TCloseAction);
begin
{$IFDEF DARWIN}
  Action := caFree;
  AboutBox := nil;  {Okay to display again}
{$ENDIF}
end;
</pre>

Note this assumes you're using the global form variable that the Delphi and
Lazarus form designers declare for you automatically. On Mac, we're also
using that variable to determine whether it's okay to display the dialog
since we don't want multiple instances of it.<p>

What else can you do to make your forms look and act more like they do on a 
Mac? Well, you can make sure that tabbing between controls works correctly.<p>

On a Mac, quite a few controls such as buttons, combo boxes and
so on do not receive the keyboard focus. They can only be operated with the 
mouse. This interferes with normal VCL/LCL tab stops. In fact, it's impossible 
to tab past one of these controls unless you set the control's
TabStop property to False. Again, if you're targeting only Mac, this is easy
to do. But if your app targets Windows too, that just flips the tabbing problem 
back to Windows.<p>

The XDev Toolkit's DfmToLfm converter handles this by inserting TabStop = False
into the .lfm files it creates from Delphi .dfm files. You could do something 
similar. That is, you could have two sets of .lfm files. You only edit one set 
and auto-create the other using some kind of converter, which inserts the 
TabStop property. Then on Mac you would conditionally use the second set of 
forms.<p>


<A name="VersionInfo"></A><H3>Info.plist file and version info</H3>

OS X uses property list files (<b>.plist</b> extension) in a number of places. 
One of the first places you'll encounter a property list file is in your
app bundle's <b>Info.plist</b> file.<p>

A property list file is just an XML file of key-value pairs. You tell OS X
about your app via the app's Info.plist file. You can also use it to store
version information for your app.<p>

Actually, there's already a number of keys in the Info.plist file that
correspond to items in a version resource embedded in a Windows 
executable. For example, the Info.plist key CFBundleShortVersionString 
key is similar to FileVersion and the NSHumanReadableCopyright key can 
be used like LegalCopyright.<p>

When you first compile a Lazarus app, you can let the IDE create the app
bundle and its Info.plist file for you, but this is only the most rudimentary
of Info.plist files. To edit and add to it, you can either use a text editor
or you can double-click the Info.plist file and edit it in the OS X <b>Property
List Editor</b> app.<p>

You can also add your own custom keys, naming the key using your app's bundle 
identifier to ensure they're unique and won't collide with any future 
Apple keys. For example, your bundle identifier should be in this form:<p>

<pre>
  &lt;key&gt;CFBundleIdentifier&lt;/key&gt;
  &lt;string&gt;com.mycompany.myapp&lt;/string&gt;
</pre>

Now just use it to prefix your own keys, like this to add CompanyName 
to your Info.plist file:<p>

<pre>
  &lt;key&gt;com.mycompany.myapp.CompanyName&lt;/key&gt;
  &lt;string&gt;My Company, Inc.&lt;/string&gt;
</pre>

To retrieve version info (or anything else) from your app's Info.plist file
at runtime (for use in an About box, for example), you can employ
something like this little function from the PropListUtil unit:<p>

<pre>
function GetInfoPlistString(const KeyName : string) : string;
 {Retrieve key's string value from app bundle's Info.plist file.}
var
  BundleRef : CFBundleRef;
  KeyRef    : CFStringRef;
  ValueRef  : CFTypeRef;
begin
  Result := '';
  BundleRef := CFBundleGetMainBundle;
  if BundleRef = nil then  {Executable not in an app bundle?}
    Exit;
  AnsiStrToCFStr(KeyName, KeyRef);
  try
    ValueRef := CFBundleGetValueForInfoDictionaryKey(BundleRef, KeyRef);
    if CFGetTypeID(ValueRef) &lt;&gt; CFStringGetTypeID then  {Value not a string?}
      Exit;
    Result := CFStrToAnsiStr(ValueRef);
  finally
    FreeCFRef(KeyRef);
    end;
end;  {GetInfoPlistString}
</pre>

You use the function like this in your program:<p>

<pre>
  BundleName := GetInfoPlistString('CFBundleName');
  BundleId := GetInfoPlistString('CFBundleIdentifier');
  CompanyName := GetInfoPlistString(BundleId + '.CompanyName');
</pre>

You can also use the PropListUtil unit's TCFPropertyList class to load an
entire property list file.<p>

For more information about Info.plist keys, refer to Apple's docs:<p>

<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Introduction/Introduction.html">Information Property List Key Reference</a>


<A name="Preferences"></A><H3>Preferences</H3>

Application preferences are stored in the ~/Library/Preferences folder. OS X
automatically creates a preferences file for you when you run your app, naming
it using your app's bundle identifier with the .plist extension.<p>

Since preferences are stored in a property list file (key-value pairs), the
preference values can be any of the property list object types (CFString, 
CFBoolean, CFNumber, CFDate, CFData, CFArray and CFDictionary). For example
to write a string value to the preferences file, you could use the 
TCFPreferences class from the PrefsUtil unit:<p>

<pre>
  Prefs := TCFPreferences.Create;
  try
    Prefs.SetAppString('Editor:FontName', 'Monaco');
  finally
    Prefs.Free;
    end;
</pre>

Note the format of the key name. This is the way TextWrangler
names its preference keys; it seems like a good approach.<p>

To read a preference string value, you can use the same class:<p>

<pre>
  Prefs := TCFPreferences.Create;
  try
    FontName := Prefs.GetAppString('Editor:FontName');
  finally
    Prefs.Free;
    end;
</pre>

For more information about preferences, refer to Apple's docs:<p>

<A HREF="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPRuntimeConfig/Articles/UserPreferences.html">The Preferences System</a>

<A name="DropFiles"></A><H3>Double-clicking and dropping your app's files</H3>

The Lazarus wiki covers how to add an icon to your app bundle so the icon is
displayed on the Dock for your app:<p>

<A HREF="http://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/OS_X_Programming_Tips#Adding_an_icon_to_your_app_bundle">Adding an icon to your app bundle</a><p>

The next step is to associate that icon with file types that your app can open 
and also to associate those file types with your app. You do that by adding
a section to your app bundle's Info.plist file that looks like this (for
files with the .myext extension):<p>

<pre>
  &lt;key&gt;CFBundleDocumentTypes&lt;/key&gt;
  &lt;array&gt;
    &lt;dict&gt;
      &lt;key&gt;CFBundleTypeRole&lt;/key&gt;
      &lt;string&gt;Editor&lt;/string&gt;
      &lt;key&gt;CFBundleTypeExtensions&lt;/key&gt;
      &lt;array&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;myext&lt;/string&gt;
      &lt;/array&gt;
      &lt;key&gt;CFBundleTypeIconFile&lt;/key&gt;
      &lt;string&gt;myapp.icns&lt;/string&gt;
      &lt;key&gt;CFBundleTypeMIMETypes&lt;/key&gt;
      &lt;string&gt;text/myapp&lt;/string&gt;
      &lt;key&gt;CFBundleTypeName&lt;/key&gt;
      &lt;string&gt;My App&lt;/string&gt;
      &lt;key&gt;CFBundleTypeOSTypes&lt;/key&gt;
      &lt;array&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;****&lt;/string&gt;
      &lt;/array&gt;
    &lt;/dict&gt;
  &lt;/array&gt;
</pre>

But this isn't really of much use if your app can't open a file that's been
double-clicked. Typically on Windows you check ParamStr(1) at startup to see if
a file name was passed to the app on the command line as a result of double
clicking the file. But ParamStr doesn't work that way on OS X. Instead,
you need to add a drop-file handler to your main form, as follows:<p>

<pre>
{$IFDEF DARWIN}
    procedure DropFiles(      Sender   : TObject;
                        const FileNames: array of string);
{$ENDIF}                        
</pre>

Then do this at startup, for example in your main form's FormCreate handler:<p>

<pre>
{$IFDEF DARWIN}
  OnDropFiles := DropFiles;
{$ENDIF}
</pre>

And implement the handler like this:<p>

<pre>
{$IFDEF DARWIN}
procedure TMainForm.DropFiles(      Sender    : TObject;
                              const FileNames : array of string);
 {When start app by double-clicking one of its files,
   file name passed to this event handler.}
begin
  if High(FileNames) &gt;= 0 then  {At least one file passed?}
    begin
    {do something with FileNames[0]}
    end;
end;
{$ENDIF}                        
</pre>

A few things worth noting:<p>
<ul>
  <li>OnDropFiles is a standard event property that can be set in the Lazarus 
      form designer. However, you can also set it at runtime like this, for
      example if you want to conditionally restrict it and its handler to Mac.<p>
  <li>This method also adds support for opening a file that's been dropped
      on your app on the Dock. If your app is not currently running, this 
      also starts your app.<p>
  <li>Since FileNames is an array, this means more than one file can be
      dropped and opened at the same time, for example if your app supports
      a multiple document interface.<p>
  <li>If your app can only open one file at a time (single document interface), 
      you'll probably want to check in the event handler if a file is already 
      open and whether it needs to be saved first before the new file is opened.
</ul>

For more information on the relevant Info.plist keys, consult Apple's docs.


<A name="Help"></A><H3>Help</H3>

On the Mac, you can add simple help to your app without any programming.
If your help is in a single HTML file, here's all you have to do:<p>

<OL>
  <LI>Create a help folder below your app bundle's Resources folder, for example
      named Help.<p>
  <LI>Add this tag to the &lt;head&gt; section of your HTML file:<br>
<pre>
  &lt;meta name="AppleTitle" content="My App's Help"&gt;
</pre>
  <LI>Place your HTML file in the help folder.<p>
  <LI>Add two keys to your app bundle's Info.plist file:<br>
<pre>
  &lt;key&gt;CFBundleHelpBookFolder&lt;/key&gt;
  &lt;string&gt;Help&lt;/string&gt;
  &lt;key&gt;CFBundleHelpBookName&lt;/key&gt;
  &lt;string&gt;My App's Help&lt;/string&gt;
</pre>
</OL>

This automatically adds a Help menu with two items to your app's menu bar.
The first item is the familiar Search command with its text box where you
type in a help topic or keyword to search for. The second item is for your
help file - when you choose it, your HTML file will be displayed in the
OS X <b>Help Viewer</b> app.<p>

To provide context sensitive help and also searchable topics and keywords,
you use the OS X <b>Help Indexer</b> app:<p>
<OL>
  <LI>Create your help folder in a localized folder below Resources. For
      example, if your help is in English, the localized folder would be
      named English.lproj. That is, the path to your help folder would be 
      myapp.app/Contents/Resources/English.lproj/Help (note you don't have
      to name it "Help").<p>
  <LI>Split up your HTML help into an index file and one file for each topic.
      The index file is the only one with the meta tag given above.<p>
  <LI>Start Help Indexer and select your help folder. You can also drag and
      drop the folder to the Help Indexer on the Dock. Or you can use the 
      command line utility, <b>hiutil</b>, as follows (change to your help folder 
      in <b>Terminal</b>):<p>
<pre>
  hiutil -Caf Help.helpindex .
</pre>
</OL>

Now you can search keywords and HTML anchors (if you indexed them too) in
Help | Search. To display a topic from within your program when a help
button is clicked, do this:<p>

<OL>
  <LI>Set the form's HelpType to htKeyword.<p>
  <LI>Set the form's HelpKeyword to the anchor's name.<p>
  <LI>Add a handler like this for the form's help button:<p>
</OL>

<pre>
procedure TForm1.Button1Click(Sender: TObject);
var
  AnchorCFStrRef : CFStringRef;
  Status         : OSStatus;
begin
  AnsiStrToCFStr(HelpKeyword, AnchorCFStrRef);
  Status := AHLookupAnchor(nil, AnchorCFStrRef);
  FreeCFRef(AnchorCFStrRef);
end;
</pre>

A few things worth noting:<p>
<ul>
  <li>Mac programs usually do not have context-sensitive help that's displayed 
      when F1 or another key is pressed. Cmd+Shift+? is normally reserved to 
      display the Help Search menu, not to display a help topic for the current 
      context.<p>
  <li>If your main menu already has a Help menu, you'll need to remove it so
      you don't have two Help menus:<p>
<pre>
  MainMenu.Items.Remove(HelpMenu);
</pre>
  <li>While developing your help, you may find that the help system's caching is 
      preventing you from seeing changes. If so, just delete these two folders 
      from ~/Library/Caches:<p>
<pre>
  com.apple.helpviewer
  com.apple.helpd
</pre>
      If order to empty the trash, you may need to shut down <b>helpd</b> 
      (although it usually shuts down on its own in a few minutes). You can 
      use the OS X <b>Activity Monitor</b> app to do this.
</ul>

You can add video or just about anything you want to your help. For more
information, consult Apple's docs:<p>
