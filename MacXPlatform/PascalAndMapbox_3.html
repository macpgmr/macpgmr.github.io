<a name="Introduction"></a><h2>Introduction</h2>

When developing with Pascal in Xcode, you use the same Objective C classes 
that you would in a Swift or Objective C app. You do this via code that
you write in Free Pascal's 
<a href="http://wiki.freepascal.org/FPC_PasCocoa#Objective-C_FPC_Compiler">Objective Pascal</a>
dialect.<p>

With Objective Pascal, you work directly with the
<a href="https://mapbox.github.io/mapbox-gl-native/macos">Mapbox classes</a>; 
there is no wrapper for the Mapbox framework, just an interface unit that 
declares the Mapbox classes.<p>
<hr>


<a name="SettingUp"></a><h2>Setting up</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Follow the steps given in "Setting up" in
      <a href="PascalAndMapbox_2.html#SettingUp">Part 2</a>.<p>

  <li>Download ProjectXC from
      <a href="https://macpgmr.github.io/ObjP/ProjectXC.html">here</a>.
      ProjectXC contains a template for creating a
      Pascal project to work with Mapbox in Xcode.<p>

      Double-click the .zip and move the resulting folder anywhere you like.<p>

  <li>Optionally, add Xcode support for
      <a href="https://macpgmr.github.io/ObjP/Xcode_Highlighting.html">Pascal syntax highlighting</a>.<p>
</ol>
<hr>


<a name="Installing"></a><h2>Installing</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Run the <b>compile-appkit.sh</b> script in the
      <b>MacOS_10_10-master</b> folder.<p>

      This script will compile common macOS interface units (AppKit, 
      CoreLocation, etc.) to 
      /Developer/ObjectivePascal/units/x86_64-darwin/macOS/NoCocoaAll.<p>

  <li>Run the <b>compile-mapbox.sh</b> script in the 
      <b>mapbox-macos-pascal</b> folder.<p>

      This script will compile the Mapbox interface unit to 
      /Developer/ObjectivePascal/units/x86_64-darwin/Mapbox/NoCocoaAll.<p>

  <li>Compile ProjectXC's <b>makeproj</b> utility.
</ol>

<hr>


<a name="Testing"></a><h2>Testing a simple Xcode project</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Create a new Xcode project from the ProjectXC <b>osx-mapbox</b> template
      like this (substitute your own project path):<p>
      <pre><code class="bash">./makeproj osx-mapbox ~/MyXcodeProjects/testmb1
</code></pre><p>

  <li>Open testmb1.xcodeproj in Xcode.<p>

  <li>Copy <b>Mapbox.framework</b> from the mapbox-macos-sdk folder to your 
      project's top-level folder (don't put it in the source subfolder or 
      in the .xcodeproj subfolder).<p>

  <li>Paste your Mapbox access token into the value for the 
      <b>MGLMapboxAccessToken</b> key in the <b>Info.plist</b> file.<p>

  <li>Choose Product | Run to compile and run your app. You should see
      a map of the world.<p>
</ol>

Now enter some more interesting default settings for your map.<p>

Click on <b>Main.storyboard</b> in the Project Navigator, then
select the Map View and click the <b>Attributes inspector</b> in
Utilities. Enter these values for the Map View:<p>

<ul>
  <li>Style URL: mapbox://styles/mapbox/satellite-streets-v10
  <li>Latitude: 37.92
  <li>Longitude: -107.74
  <li>Zoom level: 9
</ul>

Now run the app again to zoom in on the San Juan Mountains of southwest Colorado
in the U.S.<p>
<hr>


<a name="Example"></a><h2>BoxCast ObjP: an example app</h2>

The source for BoxCast ObjP, a more extensive example, is included in the
mapbox-macos-pascal folder. BoxCast ObjP is an Objective Pascal version 
of the original Boxcast JavaScript app given
<a href="https://macpgmr.github.io/MacXPlatform/PascalDynLibs_3.html#Mapbox">here</a>.<p>

BoxCast ObjP uses the NDFD framework for retrieving weather forecast data 
to display on the map. BoxCastObjP also demonstrates how to do the following:<p>

<ul>
  <li>Add an event handler for when the map is double-clicked.
  <li>Call a dynamic library (in NDFD.framework), passing the double-clicked
      coordinates to retrieve weather forecast data for that location.
  <li>Add a point to the map at the double-clicked coordinates, labeling
      it with the retrieved data.
</ul>

If you want to compile and run BoxCast ObjP yourself, here are the steps:<p>

<ol>
  <li>Copy <b>Mapbox.framework</b> from the mapbox-macos-sdk folder to the
      top-level BoxCast_ObjP folder.<p>

  <li>Create <b>NDFD.framework</b> and copy it to the BoxCast_ObjP
      folder (alongside Mapbox.framework). Instructions for creating
      NDFD.framework are <a href="https://macpgmr.github.io/MacXPlatform/PascalDynLibs_2.html">here</a>.<p>

  <li>In the ndfd folder, run this script to compile the NdfdLib interface
      unit to the "standard" location under /Developer/ObjectivePascal/units:<p>
      <pre><code class="bash">./compile-ndfdlib-macos.sh Framework
</code></pre><p>

  <li>Open <b>BoxCast_ObjP.xcodeproj</b> in Xcode.<p>

  <li>Paste your Mapbox access token into the value for the 
      <b>MGLMapboxAccessToken</b> key in the <b>Info.plist</b> file.<p>

  <li>Choose Product | Run to compile and run the app.<p>
</ol>
<hr>

<a name="MiscNotes"></a><h2>Misc. notes</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Note the things that Cocoa provides without any effort on your part.
      For example, it saves the app window's position and size. And Mapbox
      saves its map location and zoom level automatically. You don't have
      to do these things yourself.<p>

      (With the standard Cocoa menus, you also get an About box without
      any additional work. You can easily customize it by setting
      the credits in the app delegate's displayAboutBox method
      provided by the template.)<p>

      Where does Cocoa save this information? Well, under ~/Library of
      course, using the app's bundle ID (eg, com.mydomain.myapp). That's
      one reason why it's important to use a unique bundle ID for each
      app.<p>

      Here are the ~/Library locations that your app uses:<p>

      <ul>
        <li>Preferences/bundle-ID.plist -- app preference settings that
            you save with the Foundation
            <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuserdefaults">NSUserDefaults</a>
            class are saved in this file.
        <li>Saved Application State/bundle-ID.savedState -- window position
            and size are saved in the windows.plist file in this folder.
        <li>Application Support/bundle-ID/.mapbox -- Mapbox caches data
            in this hidden folder.
        <li>Application Support/com.apple.sharedfilelist/com.apple.LSSharedFileList.ApplicationRecentDocuments/bundle-ID.sfl --
            list of app's recently opened files are saved in this file.
        <li>Caches/bundle-ID -- app caches data in this folder.
      </ul><p>

      From the user's perspective, uninstalling an app on macOS is simple:
      just drag the app to the trash. But the above files stay behind.
      That's fine if the user installs the app again (for example, a newer
      version), because it will use the previous installation's preferences
      and settings. But to completely uninstall an app you really need to 
      delete the above files as well. You can also delete them to reset
      an app, for example during testing.<p>

  <li>By default, Xcode compiles all intermediate files and the .app bundle
      to a folder for the app under ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData.
      You can change this for your app (under File | Project Settings)
      or for any new app (Xcode | Preferences, on the Locations tab).<p>

  <li>Note that there are two ways to set your app's Mapbox access token.
      Setting it in the app's Info.plist file, as given in the examples
      above, is the recommended way. However, since any user can look at your 
      app's Info.plist file (it's just XML), you might want to set the access
      token <a href="https://mapbox.github.io/mapbox-gl-native/macos/0.6.1/Classes/MGLAccountManager.html#/c:objc(cs)MGLAccountManager(cm)setAccessToken:">
      in code</a>.
