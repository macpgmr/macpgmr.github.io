<A name="Introduction"></A><H2>Introduction</H2>

These notes describe the current status of the Pascal for GIS toolkit. They 
assume that you know something about GIS. If you're just starting out with GIS,
you may find that browsing an online resource like this will be helpful:<P>

<A HREF="http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/encyclopedia/geographic-information-system-gis/?ar_a=1">GIS (geographic information system)</A><P>

Pascal has never been relevant in the world of GIS; nor is that situation likely
to change. Historically the primary language of GIS has been
C++ for the low-level libraries and the GIS application itself, supplemented
by Python for writing scripts that utilize the libraries and for developing 
plugins that extend the GIS app. In recent years, C# has emerged as a language 
for doing both the low- and high-level stuff with the same language.<P>

Nevertheless, that doesn't mean you can't use Pascal with GIS. Here are a few
examples of where Pascal might make sense:<P>

<UL>
  <LI>A Pascal console app that uses a geoprocessing library. Or add this
      capability to an existing Pascal app.
  <LI>A Pascal library that can be called from a .NET/Mono GIS.
  <LI>A Pascal module that can be called from a Python plugin for a GIS.
  <LI>A Swift app that uses Apple's Map Kit framework and a Pascal
      library on OS X.
  <LI>An Objective Pascal app that displays a map in a WebView
      browser control on OS X.
</UL>

Typically you would use Pascal for parts of these tasks to take advantage of existing
Pascal code that you don't want to rewrite in one or more other languages. Note that if you 
put your Pascal code into a compiled library, you can use it with code written 
in virtually any language (C, C#, Python, even Swift), meaning you only have 
to write it once to use with multiple GIS tools.<P>


<HR>
<A name="WhatsIncluded"></A><H2>What's Included</H2>

The Pascal for GIS toolkit includes units and example code for working
with several of the GIS tools listed below. The examples range from do-it-yourself 
without mapping (testgdal), to a simple map with basic pan and zoom (SwiftCast
and QxCast), to a clickable but read-only map (AspCast), to a clickable 
read-write map (PyCast and PasCast). The primary focus is Mac OS X, but several 
of the examples can be tested on Windows and Linux too. The Free Pascal compiler 
is assumed throughout, but Delphi can generally be used as well on Windows.<P>

<HR>
<A name="SettingUp"></A><H2>Setting Up</H2>

<OL>
<LI><B>Free Pascal compiler</B><P>

Install the latest stable version.<P>

<A HREF="http://freepascal.org">freepascal.org</A>

<LI><B>Pascal for GIS source code</B><P>

All example code mentioned in this article is available here:

<A HREF="p4g.zip">p4g.zip</A><P>

If you haven't already done so, you'll probably want to review 
<A HREF="PascalDynLibs.html">Part 1</A> and <A HREF="PascalDynLibs_2.html">Part 2</A>
of the Pascal Dynamic Libraries articles, which explain the library-related code.

<LI><B>GIS libraries and apps</B><P>

Install the GIS libraries and apps listed in the table above that you're interested in.<P>

<B><I>Tip:</I></B> If you install QGIS, you also get the GDAL library,
the SAGA command-line program and libraries, and Python (the latter Windows-only; 
OS X and Linux already have Python installed).

<LI><B>Sample data</B><P>

This toolkit does not include sample data except for what's included with the
examples. If you need more, download the classic Spearfish dataset from here:<P>

<A HREF="http://grass.osgeo.org/download/sample-data/">grass.osgeo.org/download/sample-data</A><P>

<B><I>Tip:</I></B> Use this Web site to zoom in on any location in the USA and
clip out and download GIS layers for up to 10,000 acres. Included in the
downloaded zip file will be soil and watershed shapefiles (vector data)
as well as an elevation data file, aerial photo and topographic map (raster data):<P>

<HR>
<A name="GDAL"></A><H2>Testing the GDAL unit</H2>

The GDAL library has a C interface, so you'll need to parse GDAL's
header files (.h) before you can use GDAL with Pascal. Some of this has already
been done for you and is included as the GDAL unit in the Pascal for GIS
source.<P>

<H3>Obtaining the GDAL library</H3>

To obtain the GDAL library on Windows, just install SAGA GIS, DotSpatial or
QGIS as these all include GDAL. You can also download GDAL from here:<P>

<A HREF="http://www.gisinternals.com">http://www.gisinternals.com</A><P>

To obtain the GDAL library on OS X, there are two options:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Download the "GDAL Complete" .dmg from here:<P>
    <A HREF="http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks">http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks</A><P>
    This .dmg installs GDAL and several other frameworks (PROJ, GEOS, etc.)
    into /Library/Frameworks.
    Note that these frameworks are required for QGIS on OS X and can also be used
    with SAGA GIS and DotSpatial on OS X. Note that the frameworks
    are all universal, meaning they can be used with both 32- and 64-bit apps.

<LI>Build GDAL yourself.<P>
  <UL>
  <LI>Download the GDAL .tar.gz file from here:<P>
      <A HREF="http://www.gdal.org">http://www.gdal.org</A>
  <LI>Unzip in its own directory, then in that directory enter:<P>
<PRE>
  ./configure
  make
</PRE><P>
      This creates a 64-bit libgdal.1.dylib (and libgdal.dylib symlink) in .libs
      subdir, ready for installing (optional) in /usr/local/lib with:<P>
<PRE>
  make install
</PRE>
  <LI>However, since Mono is currently 32-bit only on Mac, you can do this instead:<P>
<PRE>
  ./configure CFLAGS="-Os -arch i386 -arch x86_64" CXXFLAGS="-Os -arch i386 -arch x86_64" LDFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64"
  make clean
  make
</PRE>
      This creates a universal library. If you need only a 32-bit library,
      just omit the x86_64 switches.
  </UL><P>

Build the PROJ library too (if you need to reproject spatial data).<P>
  <UL>
  <LI>Download the PROJ .tar.gz file from here:<P>
      <A HREF="http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/">http://trac.osgeo.org/proj</A>
  <LI>Compile the PROJ library the same as GDAL above.
</OL>

<H3>Testing the GDAL library</H3>

To test the GDAL unit with the GDAL library, change to the directory where
the GDAL unit source files and <B>testgdal.pas</B> are located. This simple
console app can be used to display a few bits of information about virtually
any vector or raster data file.<P>

Note that depending on what version of the GDAL library you want to test,
you may need to edit GDAL.pas and specify the library name 
to use with Windows if it's different from the default (gdal111.dll).<P>

To test the app with the GDAL library on OS X, do one of the following:<P>

<OL>
<LI>If you built and installed GDAL to /usr/local/lib as described above,
you don't need to do anything.<P>
<LI>If you built GDAL above, but did <I>not</I> install it, copy libgdal.1.dylib
to where testgdal.pas is located, then enter this:
<PRE>
  mv libgdal.1.dylib libgdal.dylib
  install_name_tool libgdal.dylib -id ./libgdal.dylib
</PRE>
<LI>If you installed the GDAL framework and want to use it instead of the library, 
compile with the -dGDAL_FRAMEWORK switch to link against the GDAL framework 
instead of the library.
</OL>

Now compile the testgdal app:
<PRE>
  ppc386 testgdal
</PRE>

Note that if you have only the 64-bit GDAL library, you'll need 
to compile testgdal.pas with ppcx64 (OS X) or ppcrossx64 (Windows).<P>

On OS X, you can see what the executable is linked against as follows:<P>

<PRE>
  otool -L testgdal
</PRE>

To test the app with the GDAL library on Windows, you'll need a path to the GDAL 
library. For example, to use QGIS's GDAL library with the test app, enter this 
in a batch file:<P>
<PRE>
  setlocal
  set PATH=C:\Program Files (x86)\QGIS\bin;%PATH%
  testgdal %1%
</PRE>

Run the app and specify a vector or raster file to examine. Examples:<P>

<PRE>
  On OS X:     ./testgdal someshapefile.shp
  On Windows:  testgdal.bat somegridfile.asc
</PRE>

<H3>Testing the GDAL and PROJ libraries</H3>

If the GDAL library can find the PROJ library, you can also use the GDAL
transformation (projection) functions. The <B>testshapes.pas</B> console app is
supplied for testing these functions.<P>

On OS X, compile the testshapes app like this:<P>

<PRE>
  ppc386 -Fu../ndfd testshapes
</PRE>

To use the GDAL and PROJ frameworks instead of the libraries, include the
-dGDAL_FRAMEWORK switch.<P>

On Windows, compile the testshapes app like this:<P>

<PRE>
  ppc386 -Fu..\ndfd testshapes
</PRE>

When run, testshapes will create the locations shapefile used in the PasCast
example below.<P>

<HR>
<A name="WebMaps"></A><H2>SwiftCast: Using a Pascal library and Bing Maps in a Swift app</H2>

SwiftCast is an example app for OS X that shows how to:<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Use a Pascal library in a Swift app. Specifically it uses the ndfd library
      and its Swift wrapper class from <A HREF="PascalDynLibs_2.html">Part 2</A>
      of Pascal Dynamic Libraries to retrieve weather forecast data.
  <LI>Use a WebView control in a Swift app as an embedded Web browser.
  <LI>Load a local HTML file containing a bit of JavaScript
      that displays a map of forecast data using Bing Maps.
</UL>

A screenshot of SwiftCast is here: <A HREF="SwiftCast.jpg">SwiftCast.jpg</A><P>

To try out SwiftCast, you have two options:
<UL>
  <LI>Open SwiftCast.xcodeproj in Xcode and choose Product | Run. Make sure 
      you've compiled the ndfd library beforehand.
  <LI>Download SwiftCast.dmg from here: <A HREF="SwiftCast.dmg">SwiftCast.dmg</A><BR>
      This .dmg has not been codesigned, so right-click on SwiftCast.dmg and 
      choose Open rather than double-clicking it.
</UL>

A screenshot of the SwiftCast project in Xcode is here: 
<A HREF="SwiftCast-Xcode.jpg">SwiftCast-Xcode.jpg</A><P>

Notes on SwiftCast:<P>
<OL>
  <LI>SwiftCast loads file <B>viewForecast.bing.6.2.html</B> into its WebView
      control. This file's JavaScript code uses version 6.2 of Bing Maps. 
      One drawback to version 6.2 is
      that it doesn't appear to have a way to label points on the map directly.
      Instead, you position the mouse over a location's pushpin and its label
      will pop up. Bing 7.0 has a way to label
      points directly, but 7.0 requires signing up for a developer account
      to use it. Google Maps could also be used. To use a different mapping 
      service, just replace JavaScript functions showMap and showLocation,
      which look like this for Bing 6.2:
      <pre><code class="javascript">    function showMap(lat, lon) {
      map = new VEMap('map');
      map.LoadMap(new VELatLong(lat, lon), 10, VEMapStyle.Road, false);
    }

    function showLocation(lat, lon, location, forecast) {
      var point = new VELatLong(lat, lon);
      var pin = new VEShape(VEShapeType.Pushpin, point);
      pin.SetTitle(location);
      pin.SetDescription(forecast);
      map.AddShape(pin);
    }</code></pre>

  <LI>SwiftCast loads a local copy of an HTML file into its WebView control,
      looking for it in its Resources folder using this bit of code:
      <pre><code class="bash">    let htmlPath = NSBundle.mainBundle().resourcePath! + "/viewForecast.bing.6.2.html"</code></pre>
      But there's no reason why this file couldn't be loaded by specifying an
      http:// location. That would allow you to update the HTML that's loaded
      without needing to update the app itself.<P>

  <LI>Several of the default menus that Xcode's template adds to a new app
      are not relevant to a simple app like SwiftCast. However, these menus
      have been left alone in case someone wants to extend SwiftCast,
      for example, to support loading a file containing locations and lat/lon 
      coordinates rather than just using the app's hard-wired locations.
</OL>

Adding the ndfd library to an Xcode Swift project is fairly straightforward:<P>
<UL>
  <LI>File | Add Files and add <B>libndfd.dylib</B> (previously compiled elsewhere),
      but don't let Xcode copy the .dylib into the project.
  <LI>File | Add Files and add the library's header file (<B>ndfd.h</B>) and Swift
      wrapper class (<B>NdfdLib.swift</B>) to the project and let Xcode copy the files
      too.
  <LI>If the project does not have a bridging header file, use 
      File | New | File | OS X Source | Header File and create it 
      (<B>Bridging-Header.h</B>).
  <LI>Edit the bridging header file and add ndfd.h to it (#include "ndfd.h").
  <LI>In Build Settings, under SWIFT_OBJC_BRIDGING_HEADER, specify
      SwiftCast/Bridging-Header.h.
  <LI>In Build Phases, under Link Binary With Libraries, add libndfd.dylib.
  <LI>In Build Phases, under Copy Bundle Resources, add libndfd.dylib.
  <LI>In Build Phases, add a Run Script that fixes up the app bundle's
      libndfd.dylib and the executable that loads it:
      <pre>install_name_tool $TARGET_BUILD_DIR/$UNLOCALIZED_RESOURCES_FOLDER_PATH/libndfd.dylib -id @executable_path/../Resources/libndfd.dylib
install_name_tool $TARGET_BUILD_DIR/$EXECUTABLE_PATH -change ./libndfd.dylib @executable_path/../Resources/libndfd.dylib</pre>
</UL>


<HR>
<A name="DotSpatial"></A><H2>AspCast: Using a Pascal library in a DotSpatial ASP.NET Web app</H2>

AspCast is an example app for .NET and Mono that shows how to:<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Use a Pascal library in an ASP.NET Web app. Specifically it uses the 
      ndfd library and its C# wrapper class from <A HREF="PascalDynLibs_2.html">Part 2</A>
      of Pascal Dynamic Libraries to retrieve weather forecast data.
  <LI>Use the DotSpatial assemblies to add GIS functionality to the Web app.
  <LI>Display a clickable map using Bing Maps; clicking on the map displays
      the forecast for that point; pan and zoom to any place in the U.S.
</UL>

A screenshot of AspCast is here: <A HREF="AspCast.jpg">AspCast.jpg</A><P>

To try out AspCast, you have several options. Be sure to copy the required
DotSpatial assemblies, the ndfd native library and its interop assembly
as described below.
<UL>
  <LI>Open AspCast.sln in Xamarin Studio on Mac or Windows and choose 
      Run | Run With | Mono Soft Debugger for ASP.NET.
  <LI>If you have Visual Studio, you can also open and run AspCast.sln there.
  <LI>The MonoDevelop IDE should also work (eg, on Linux), but this 
      has not been tested.
  <LI>If you don't have any of these IDEs installed, just compile AspCast from
      the command line (enter this one level up from the refs subfolder):<P>
<pre><code>xbuild</code></pre>
      (With .NET on Windows, use msbuild.)
  <LI>Note that once you've compiled AspCast, you can also start it from the
      command line with Mono's XSP server (enter this one level up from the 
      refs subfolder):<P>
<pre><code>xsp4</code></pre>
Then enter this in a browser:<P>
<pre><code>http://localhost:8080</code></pre>
</UL><P>

A screenshot of the AspCast project in Xamarin Studio is here: 
<A HREF="AspCast-XamarinStudio.jpg">AspCast-XamarinStudio.jpg</A><P>

Notes on AspCast:<P>

<OL>
  <LI>ASP.NET apps sometimes get shut down immediately when run with 
      Xamarin Studio's Mono Web server on Windows. If this happens,
      try running AspCast with a different Web server, such as IIS Express.<P>
  <LI>AspCast works fairly well in Safari on an iPad too, with the 
      exception of panning the map, which conflicts with normal scrolling
      within the browser.
</OL>

Creating a DotSpatial ASP.NET app is fairly straightforward:<P>
<UL>
  <LI>In Xamarin Studio, choose File | New | Solution, then under C#, select 
      ASP.NET and ASP.NET Project.
  <LI>You can immediately test this simple app by choosing Run | Run With |
      Mono Soft Debugger for ASP.NET. This will start the app and launch a
      Web browser. When done, choose Run | Stop.
  <LI>Now choose File | New | File and, under Misc, select Assembly Information.
      This will create a file where you can enter version and copyright info.
  <LI>If you'll be adding any custom buttons to the app's eventual toolbar, 
      create a subfolder named Images (or something similar).
  <LI>If you'll be displaying any shapefiles in the app, create a subfolder
      named Layers (or something similar).
  <LI>Create a subfolder named refs (or something similar). Copy the DotSpatial 
      assemblies to the refs subfolder. Where to get these assemblies?
      For convenience so you don't have to build them yourself, you can
      download pre-built assemblies from here: 
      <A HREF="DotSpatial_p4g.zip">DotSpatial_p4g.zip</A>
  <LI>If you'll be using any "unmanaged" native libraries, copy them into the
      main folder (where Default.aspx is) on OS X or into the bin subfolder
      on Windows. For example, copy the ndfd library (previously compiled elsewhere).
  <LI>Copy any native libraries' interop assemblies into the refs folder. 
      For example, copy Ndfd.Interop.dll (previously compiled elsewhere).
  <LI>Create ImageHandler.ashx and ImageHandler.ashx.cs files for the app.
      These are simple files; look at AspCast's for examples. Be sure to 
      include them in the project by right-clicking on the Solution panel
      and choosing Add | Add Files.
  <LI>Add legend, toolbar and map controls to Default.aspx and corresponding
      code to Default.aspx.cs. See AspCast for example code.

<A name="QGIS"></A><H2>PyCast: Using a Pascal module with a Python plugin for QGIS</H2>

PyCast is an example plugin for QGIS that shows how to:<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Use a Pascal library with Python. Specifically it uses the ndfd library
      and its compiled module and Python wrapper class from <A HREF="PascalDynLibs_2.html">Part 2</A> of 
      Pascal Dynamic Libraries to retrieve weather forecast data.
  <LI>Display forecasts for points in a layer in the supplied PyCast.qgs project;
      pan and zoom to any place in the U.S. and add points to this layer.
  <LI>Display a background map with the QGIS OpenLayers plugin; the PyCast.qgs
      project uses Apple Maps.
</UL>

A screenshot of PyCast is here: <A HREF="PyCast.jpg">PyCast.jpg</A><P>

To try out the PyCast plugin, follow these steps to add it to QGIS:<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Install the OpenLayers plugin. In QGIS, choose Plugins | Manage and
      Install Plugins.<P>
  <LI>Copy the PyCast folder to QGIS's plugins folder. On OS X, plugins are
      installed under:<P>
      ~/.qgis2/python/plugins<P>
      On Windows, QGIS plugins are installed under:<P>
      \Users\yourname\.qgis2\python\plugins
  <LI>Compile the ndfd library and its Pascal module, then copy these two
      binary files into the PyCast folder (that you created under plugins).
      QGIS uses Python 2.7.x, so don't use the Python 3 module; also, be sure
      to copy the 32-bit library and module with 32-bit QGIS or the 64-bit
      library and module with 64-bit QGIS (on Mac, QGIS is only 64-bit, so 
      both the 64-bit and "fat" binaries will work).<P>
  <LI>On OS X, fix up the library and module so the module can find and load
      the library:
      <PRE>install_name_tool libndfd.dylib -id @loader_path/libndfd.dylib
install_name_tool ndfdmod.so -change ./libndfd.dylib @loader_path/libndfd.dylib</PRE>
  <LI>In QGIS, choose Plugins | Manage and Install Plugins, then
      check the PyCast plugin to enable it.<P>
  <LI>Choose Web | PyCast to see the PyCast commands; there's also a
      PyCast button on the toolbar.<P>
  <LI>Finally, in QGIS, choose Project | Open and select the PyCast.qgs project 
      in the PyCast_Example folder. Now follow the PyCast help.
</UL>

Notes on PyCast:<P>
<OL>
  <LI>Typically QGIS plugins are installed in a submenu under one of the standard 
      program menus, so the PyCast plugin is installed under the Web menu
      along with the OpenLayers plugin.<P>

  <LI>QGIS plugins are usually downloaded and installed automatically via 
      the plugin manager, but since PyCast requires two binary files that 
      you need to build, it isn't currently distributed that way.<P>
      
  <LI>Sometimes OpenLayers maps don't fully download and a few tiles may be
      blank. You can usually remedy this by choosing View | Refresh or
      panning the map a little bit to force the tiles to be reloaded.
</OL>

Creating a Python plugin for QGIS involves several tools. Since the Python
source for all plugins is included, you might find it easier just to adapt
an existing plugin or learn how to write a plugin by reviewing the code of
PyCast or other plugins. However, you can also follow these steps to create 
a simple plugin that will be installed under the Plugins menu:<P>

<UL>
  <LI>Install the Plugin Builder plugin in QGIS and use it to create the 
      rudiments of a new plugin.
  <LI>Use Qt Designer to design a dialog box for your plugin.
  <LI>Convert the .ui file created by Qt Designer to Python code with the 
      pyuic4 utility included with QGIS. See the example comp-ui.sh script 
      included with PyCast.
  <LI>Convert icons and other resources to Python code with the pyrcc4 utility
      included with QGIS. See the example comp-qrc.sh script included with PyCast.
  <LI>Use a text editor or Python IDE to add code to your plugin and edit
      the plugin's metadata.txt file.

<A name="P4G_Ctrls"></A><H2>PasCast: Using a Pascal library with Lazarus GIS controls</H2>

PasCast is a cross-platform example app for Lazarus that shows how to:<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Use a Pascal library in a Lazarus LCL app. Specifically it uses the 
      ndfd library and its Pascal wrapper class from Part 2 of Pascal Dynamic 
      Libraries to retrieve weather forecast data. 
  <LI>Use the P4G_Ctrls GIS controls for Lazarus.
  <LI>Display a clickable map of image and vector layers.
</UL>

A screenshot of PasCast is here: <A HREF="PasCast.jpg">PasCast.jpg</A><P>

To try out PasCast, you have two options:
<UL>
  <LI>Open pascast.lpi in Lazarus and compile it. Make sure you've first followed
      the steps in the PasCast folder's <B>ReadMe.txt</B> file to set up PasCast's
      dependencies in Lazarus.
  <LI>With OS X, you can download PasCast.dmg from here: <A HREF="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/28343282/MacXPlatform/PasCast.dmg">PasCast.dmg</A><BR>
      This .dmg has not been codesigned, so right-click on PasCast.dmg and 
      choose Open rather than double-clicking it.
</UL>

A screenshot of the PasCast project in Lazarus is here: 
<A HREF="PasCast-Lazarus.jpg">PasCast-Lazarus.jpg</A><P>

Notes on PasCast:<P>
<OL>
  <LI>The downloadable PasCast.dmg's app bundle includes all of the layer files 
      PasCast needs, as well as its own copies of the GDAL, PROJ and ndfd 
      libraries, so you don't need to install anything else to run it.<P>
  <LI>After compiling PasCast, Lazarus will attempt to run the fixlazbundle.sh
      script to fix up the PasCast.app bundle on OS X. This script is not
      needed on other platforms and will fail with an error message in the
      build log. You can ignore this message on other platforms.<P>
  <LI>PasCast displays a map of an area of southwestern Colorado. While the
      area is not large geographically as weather forecasts go, it does have
      dramatic changes in elevation (>1000m). When you click around on the map
      to get a forecast, you would expect the forecast to change, but it 
      mostly doesn't, suggesting that the NDFD forecast model does not fully
      account for local elevation differences.
</OL>

Using the P4G_Ctrls GIS controls with Lazarus is fairly straightforward:<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Install the GDAL framework (OS X) or install the GDAL and PROJ 
      libraries (Windows and Linux) as described above.
  <LI>Compile the <B>gdal_pkg.lpk</B> runtime package.
  <LI>Compile and install the <B>p4g_ctrls.lpk</B> design/runtime package.<P>
      <I>Warning:</I> Installing the p4g_ctrls package will link Lazarus to GDAL, 
      meaning you will need the GDAL framework installed (OS X) or the GDAL 
      library somewhere on the path in order to start Lazarus.
  <LI>In Lazarus, add a TP4G_Legend control to your form and set the control's
      Align property to alLeft.
  <LI>Add a TSplitter control to the form.
  <LI>Add a TP4G_Map control to the form and set the control's Align property
      to alClient.
  <LI>Programmatically add image and vector layers to the map. See PasCast 
      for example code.
  <LI>Remember that the p4g_ctrls controls are just prototypes, meaning they're
      incomplete and subject to change.
