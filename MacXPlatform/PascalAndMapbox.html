<a name="Introduction"></a><h2>Introduction</h2>

<a href="https://www.mapbox.com">Mapbox</a> is everywhere these days, or so it seems.
Mapbox's JavaScript library was even the focus of a <a href="https://delftswa.gitbooks.io/desosa-2017/content/mapbox-gl-js/chapter.html">student book chapter</a>.
And Mapbox the company was mentioned in a recent issue of 
<a href="https://www.economist.com/news/business/21723173-not-all-roads-lead-google-maps-battle-territory-digital-cartography"><I>The Economist</I></a>.
In the area I work in, lots of 
<a href="https://www.mapbox.com/industries/agriculture">companies</a> 
are using Mapbox. I know some of these companies and respect the programming
they do. What did they know that I didn't? Maybe it was time to take a look
at Mapbox and find out.<p>

And so I did and now I'm a Mapbox user too. My needs are relatively modest
at this point, so the Mapbox free tier account is fine. I can host my maps 
and geographic data on Mapbox, with up to 50,000 map views per month
at no charge.<p>

Mapbox's business is hosting maps and data on their servers. If your needs are
big enough, you pay for that service. But they also create a ton of open source
software. In fact, they describe themselves as an 
"<a href="https://www.mapbox.com/about/open/">open source company</a>."<p>

You can use their software for free to access your maps and data in any app
that you write, whether it's a Web app, desktop app, or mobile app. Currently
I'm using <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api">Mapbox GL JS</a>, 
their WebGL-based JavaScript library, but there are a lot of native app
options available too. If you look at the list of native SDKs, there appears
to be something for everyone:<p>

<ul>
  <li>Android/Java
  <li>iOS/Objective C and Swift
  <li>macOS/Objective C and Swift
  <li>Qt/C++
</ul>

(The full list is <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/blob/master/README.md">here</a>.)<p>

Something for everyone except Pascal users, that is. Or is there something there 
for us after all? Let's take a closer look.

<a name="Cross-Platform"></a><h2>Ways of doing cross-platform</h2>

With the Lazarus IDE for the Free Pascal compilers, it's an article of faith
that "cross-platform" means the same interface everywhere and that all platforms
where those interfaces have been implemented are equal in the eyes of the IDE.
So if you design a form and write some code for it on one platform, you ought 
to be able to take your source files and compile them with Lazarus on a 
different platform. This works fairly well and is a noble sentiment, but in 
practice some platforms are more "equal" others. This approach also has trouble 
accommodating platforms such as mobile and the modern Web, which weren't around 
when the original design was set in stone.<p>

With Mapbox, cross-platform has a different meaning. Sure, there's the 
native library that's used by all native SDKs, but you normally don't work with 
it directly. Instead, you work with an SDK that's designed for a particular
language and target. For example, if you're targeting iOS or macOS, you'll
likely be using Objective C or Swift and so the Mapbox iOS and macOS SDKs provide a 
framework library that exposes Objective C classes. If you're targeting Android, 
you'll likely be using Java and so the Mapbox Android SDK provides Java classes. 
If your app uses Qt 5, you'll work with the Mapbox Qt SDK's C++ classes. 
And so on.<p>

And so even though you'll be indirectly using the same speedy OpenGL-based 
map engine that's at the heart of every native SDK, and you'll do similar things 
in a similar fashion with any map (pan, zoom, annotate, etc.), you don't do it
with common code. Instead, with Mapbox, cross-platform lies more in the 
specifications for the maps (called styles) and geographic data (typically 
vector tilesets) that you'll be using on all platforms, native and Web.<p>
 
You can create styles and tilesets with the nifty online Mapbox 
<a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio">Studio</a>, or you 
can create them locally. A 
<a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/">style</a> 
is just a JSON file that you can edit with a text editor;
<a href="https://www.mapbox.com/vector-tiles/">tilesets</a> 
can be created from various file types common to desktop GIS, 
such as shapefiles. In other words, you can do a lot of prep work without
writing a line of code for any platform. It also means you can share map styles 
with other developers and projects across all platforms. In fact, Mapbox 
provides a number of 
<a href="https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation/#styles">standard styles</a> 
that you're free to use.<p>

<a name="OnePlatformAtATime"></a><h2>One platform at a time</h2>

So where does that leave us as Pascal programmers? Well, in some ways, Mapbox's
approach is to our advantage and means we can do this one bite at a time, like 
eating the proverbial elephant. We don't need to come up with an omnibus 
solution that covers all platforms. We can pick and choose 
amongst the SDKs, both the ones available now and any future SDKs that Mapbox 
or anyone else might create. (This is another advantage of Mapbox's approach: 
they don't have to worry about a new or updated SDK affecting other 
platforms.)<p>

Looking at the available Mapbox SDKs, there are a couple obvious candidates
that we can start with and create Pascal "SDKs" for:<p>

<ul>
  <li>macOS. Although the Mapbox macOS SDK is specific to macOS, a Lazarus
      LCL control can be layered over it, thereby leaving open the possibility
      for future cross-platform support.<p>
  <li>JavaScript. The Mapbox GL library can be used both in Web apps (in a
      browser) and for embedded maps in desktop apps (in a browser control). 
      For an example, see the 
      <a href="https://macpgmr.github.io/MacXPlatform/PascalDynLibs_3.html#Mapbox">BoxCast</a>
      example app that's part of the Pascal for GIS Toolkit. Mapbox GL can also 
      be used with apps created with FPC's Pas2JS "transpiler" if you have
      a Pascal interface for Mapbox.<p>
</ul>

There are other possibilities as well, but let's start with these two.<p>
