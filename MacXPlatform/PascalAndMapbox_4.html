<a name="Introduction"></a><h2>Introduction</h2>

With Free Pascal's <a href="http://wiki.freepascal.org/pas2js">Pas2JS</a> 
compiler, you can use Pascal instead of JavaScript to work with the 
<a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api">Mapbox GL</a> JavaScript library.<p>

With Pas2JS, you can use the Pascal <b>TMap</b> class, which provides access 
to most of Mapbox's Map API.<p>
<hr>


<a name="SettingUp"></a><h2>Setting up</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Sign up for a Mapbox <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/pricing">account</a>
      if you haven't already done so. This is free to start using.<p>

  <li>Download the Pas2JS compiler (transpiler) and RTL from
      <a href="ftp://ftpmaster.freepascal.org/fpc/contrib/pas2js">here</a>.<p>

      Unzip this file anywhere you like; no installation is needed.<p>

  <li>Download the PnJ .zip from
      <a href="https://macpgmr.github.io/MacXPlatform/pnj.zip">here</a>.
      This includes the Pascal interface unit for the Mapbox GL JavaScript
      library.<p>

      Unzip this file anywhere you like; no installation is needed.

<a name="Using"></a><h2>Using the TMap class</h2>

Keep the <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api">Mapbox GL API</a> 
handy while writing your code.<p>

Here's a very simple JavaScript app that uses the Mapbox GL library:<p>

<pre><code class="javascript">mapboxgl.accessToken = 'your-access-token-goes-here';
var map = new mapboxgl.Map({
    container: 'map',
    style: 'mapbox://styles/mapbox/satellite-streets-v10',
    center: [-107.74, 37.92],
    zoom: 9
});
</code></pre><p>

See the <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/#map">Map API</a>
for information about the map options used.<p>

To test this code, do the following:<p>

<ol>
  <li>Substitute your own access token.  Sign in to your Mapbox 
      <a href="https://mapbox.com">account</a> and create an access token.
  <li>Embed the script in an HTML file like in this
      <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/simple-map">simple example</a>.
  <li>Double-click the HTML file to open it in your browser.
</ol>

Here's the Pascal equivalent of the JavaScript code. (File <b>simple-map.pas</b>
is included in the <b>simple-map</b> subdirectory of the PnJ download.)<p>

<pre><code class="delphi">program SimpleMap;

uses
  JS,
  MapboxGL;

var
  map : TMap;
begin
  accessToken := 'your-access-token-goes-here';
  map := TMap.New(new(['container', 'map',
                       'style', 'mapbox://styles/mapbox/satellite-streets-v10',
                       'center', TJSArray._of(-107.74, 37.92),
                       'zoom', 9.0]));
end.
</code></pre><p>

See the <b>mapboxgl.pas</b> interface unit in the <b>package</b> subdirectory
of the PnJ download for how <b>accessToken</b> and <b>TMap</b> are declared
<b>external</b>. The JavaScript implementations are actually in file 
<b>mapbox-gl.js</b> that you reference in your app's HTML file.<p>

Note the nifty <b>new</b> function (in the JS unit) for creating 
JavaScript objects (equivalent to { } ). And the handy <b>TJSArray._of</b> 
class function for creating JavaScript arrays (equivalent to [ ] ).<p>

To test this code, do the following:<p>

<ol>
  <li>Substitute your own access token.
  <li>From the simple-map subdirectory, convert the Pascal to JavaScript with the 
      transpiler like this (substitute the path to where you unzipped Pas2JS):<p>
      <pre><code class="bash">yourpath/bin/pas2js -Jirtl.js -Jc -Fu../package simple-map.pas</code></pre><p>
  <li>Double-click the <b>index.html</b> file in the simple-map subdirectory
      to open it in your browser.
</ol>

To review the generated JavaScript, open file <b>simple-map.js</b> in a text editor
or view the page source in your browser. Your code will be at the very end 
of the file.<p>

<a name="Example"></a><h2>BoxCast P2J: an example app</h2>

The source for BoxCast P2J, a more extensive example, is included in
the PnJ download.
BoxCast P2J is a Pascal version of the original Boxcast JavaScript app given
<a href="https://macpgmr.github.io/MacXPlatform/PascalDynLibs_3.html#Mapbox">here</a>
and is functionally equivalent to the original.<p>

BoxCast P2J demonstrates how to do the following things in Pascal:<p>

<ul>
  <li>Add a custom control (button) to the map.
  <li>Add an event handler for the button, as well as handlers for when the 
      map loads, when the map is clicked, and to change the cursor.
  <li>Add an invisible "layer" to the map to detect clicking in a particular
      region of the map.
  <li>Display simple popup dialogs.
  <li>Make an AJAX call to a server app (getforecast), passing the coordinates 
      of the clicked point and using the results of the call.
</ul>

If you want to run Boxcast P2J yourself, here are the steps:<p>

<ol>
  <li>Substitute your own access token in <b>boxcast_config.pas</b>.<p>
  <li>To test the AJAX call to the server, you'll need to compile the 
      <b>NDFD</b> dynamic library (described
      <a href="https://macpgmr.github.io/MacXPlatform/PascalDynLibs_2.html">here</a>)
      and compile and set up the <b>getforecast</b> CGI app (described
      <a href="https://macpgmr.github.io/MacXPlatform/PascalDynLibs_3.html#qooxdoo">here</a>).<p>
      Edit boxcast_config.pas to use a non-local Web server.<p>
      Note that you can run Boxcast P2J without doing this step, but you
      won't be able to retrieve any forecast data. (See the note below
      for more.)<p>
  <li>From the boxcast subdirectory, convert Pascal to JavaScript with the 
      transpiler like this (substitute the path to where you unzipped Pas2JS):<p>
      <pre><code class="bash">yourpath/bin/pas2js -Jirtl.js -Jc -O- -Fu../package boxcast_p2j.pas</code></pre><p>
  <li>Double-click the <b>index.html</b> file in the boxcast subdirectory
      to open it in your browser.
</ol>
<hr>


<a name="MiscNotes"></a><h2>Misc. notes</h2>

<ol>
  <li>The Pas2JS transpiler generates a lot of JavaScript, much more than if
      you wrote the JavaScript yourself. Is this an issue? Well, in the
      case of Mapbox apps it's probably moot. For example, the size of 
      the generated boxcast_p2j.js is only about 1/10th the size of the
      <a href="https://api.tiles.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/v0.44.1/mapbox-gl.js">mapbox-gl.js</a> 
      library it depends on. Reducing the size of the 
      generated JavaScript would not have much impact on download time.<p>

      You can reduce the amount of generated JavaScript by using the
      default optimizations. However, this can have unintended consequences.
      For example, with BoxCast P2J, pas2js strips out methods that <i>it</i>
      thinks are unused, but are called by the Mapbox library. As a result, 
      optimizations have to be disabled with the -O- switch for this example.<p>

  <li>A downside of JavaScript is that your JavaScript is visible in the
      user's browser. You can mitigate this to some extent by "obfuscating" the
      generated JavaScript, which also has the benefit of reducing its size. 
      You can use Google's
      <a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/api-tutorial2">Closure compiler</a> 
      service to do this, as follows:<p>

      <ul>
        <li>Make a copy of your generated .js file with a different name.
            Think of this file as your "source" file, where the readable code
            is. For example, with BoxCast P2J, we might generate
            a file named boxcast_p2j.debug.js.
        <li>Upload this file to somewhere on the Web that Closure can access
            (normally your own server, not a public one).
        <li>Create a Python script that looks like this:<p>
            <pre><code class="python">import httplib, urllib, sys

params = urllib.urlencode([
    ('code_url', sys.argv[1]),
    ('compilation_level', 'SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS'),
    ('output_format', 'text'),
    ('output_info', 'compiled_code'),
  ])

headers = { "Content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" }
conn = httplib.HTTPSConnection('closure-compiler.appspot.com')
conn.request('POST', '/compile', params, headers)
response = conn.getresponse()
data = response.read()
print data
conn.close()
</code></pre><p>
        <li>Run the Python script like this, redirecting its output:<p>
<pre><code class="bash">python obfuscate.py https://www.mydomain.com/boxcast_p2j.debug.js &gt;boxcast_p2j.js</code></pre><p>
            The resulting smaller boxcast_p2j.js file is what you would deploy
            instead of the original boxcast_p2j.debug.js.
      </ul>

  <li>If you look at the Pascal source for the NDFD library that the getforecast
      CGI app calls, you'll see that all it does is make an HTTP GET request to a 
      PHP script at https://graphical.weather.gov. Why not eliminate 
      getforecast and the NDFD library entirely and just call this service
      directly from boxcast_p2j.pas? After all, you can call just about
      anything on the Web with the corslite function.<p>

      Here's what BoxCast P2J does now, where fcstUrl is the CGI URL from
      boxcast_config.pas:<p>

      <pre><code class="delphi"> {Make AJAX call to server, passing coordinates of clicked point.
   corslite will call the callback function with server response.}
corslite(appSettings.fcstUrl + '?lat1=' + string(JSValue(e.lngLat.lat)) + 
          '&amp;lon1=' + string(JSValue(e.lngLat.lng)) + '&amp;geojson=true',
         @CorsCallback, True);
</code></pre><p>

      Just change it to something like this:<p>

      <pre><code class="delphi">corslite('https://graphical.weather.gov/xml/sample_products/browser_interface/ndfdBrowserClientByDay.php?' +
          'lat=' + string(JSValue(e.lngLat.lat)) + 
          '&amp;lon=' + string(JSValue(e.lngLat.lng)) + '&amp;format=24+hourly',
         @CorsCallback, True);
</code></pre><p>

      Now all you would need to do is change CorsCallback
      to parse the returned XML data and convert it to the GeoJSON data that
      BoxCast expects.<p>

      The problem is that the weather server does not support 
      <a href="https://enable-cors.org/">CORS</a> and so most browsers
      block this kind of cross-domain request. By making the call from a
      CGI app, the browser is not involved and thus can't block the
      request. (Note that the server where you deploy the CGI app will still
      need to support CORS.)<p>
