<HR>
<A name="Introduction"></A><H2>Introduction</H2>

These notes discuss testing several of <A HREF="PascalDynLibs_3.html">Part 3</A>'s 
libraries and examples on Amazon Web Services (AWS), focusing on the 
Free Tier that currently provides 12 months of free use of both Windows and 
Linux server instances.<P>

More specifically, these notes should be of interest to the following groups:<P>

<UL>
  <LI>Mac developers who want to test compiling and running code on 
      Windows or Linux.
  <LI>Developers who want to test deploying and running Web apps on an actual 
      server (not just locally).
  <LI>Anyone interested in seeing what's involved in setting up a modern
      cloud-based virtual environment.
</UL>

You can sign up for a free AWS account here: <A HREF="http://aws.amazon.com">aws.amazon.com</A><P>


<HR>
<A name="Ubuntu"></A><H2>Ubuntu server</H2>

Once you've logged into your AWS account, go to the EC2 Dashboard and create 
a Linux instance. You do this on the Instances panel by clicking Launch Instance 
and choosing an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that you want to use. The notes that 
follow assume that you've selected an <B>Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS</B> AMI.
Amazon Linux, Red Hat Linux and SUSE Linux AMIs are also available, but these
are not covered here. Note that all AMIs are 64-bit.<P>

Once you launch the instance, you'll be prompted to create a public key and
download its private key file (.pem extension). You'll need this file to SSH
into the instance from your computer.<P>

Once the instance is running, you can SSH into it. For example, on a Mac,
if your key file file is named myubuntu-1.pem, enter this in a Terminal window:<P>
<PRE>  ssh -i myubuntu-1.pem ubuntu@xx.xx.xx.xx</PRE>
where xx.xx.xx.xx is your instance's public IP address, which you can get from the
EC2 Dashboard's Instances panel. This will log you into your instance's home 
folder ("ubuntu"). Enter "exit" to log out.<P>

<B><I>Important!</I></B> If you get an error message about permissions for
your key file, be sure to do this:<P>
<PRE>  chmod 400 myubuntu-1.pem</PRE>

Once logged in, you can use sudo on your Ubuntu instance to install just about 
anything you need. We'll start with installing Free Pascal.<P>

<B><I>Tip:</I></B> If you need a text editor on your Ubuntu instance, try 
the pre-installed nano.<P>


<H3>Installing Free Pascal</H3>

Since you won't be able to run a Web browser on your Ubuntu instance via SSH, you'll 
need to use apt-get, curl, Subversion, etc. to install software. Unfortunately, 
apt-get will install an out-of-date version of the Free Pascal compiler for 
64-bit Linux. And there doesn't appear to be a directly reference-able FPC .deb 
file that can be retrieved by curl. However, you can download the FPC .deb from
the <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lazarus/files/">Lazarus SourceForge</A>
site in your computer's browser and then copy it to your 
Ubuntu instance using a script. For example, you could create a file on your 
computer named copy2ubu.sh and paste these lines into it:<P>

<PRE>if [ "$1" = "" ]; then
  echo "No file specified"
elif ! [ -e "$1" ]; then
  echo "File does not exist"
else
  scp -i myubuntu-1.pem "$1" ubuntu@ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx-xxxxx.compute.amazonaws.com:~
fi
</PRE>

(The string between the "@" and the ":" is your Ubuntu instance's public DNS, 
which can be obtained from the Instances panel.)<P>

Now use the script to copy the .deb file to your Ubuntu instance like this:<P>

<PRE>  ./copy2ubu.sh fpc_2.6.4-140420_amd64.deb</PRE>

Install the package on your Ubuntu instance like this:<P>

<PRE>  sudo dpkg -i fpc_2.6.4-140420_amd64.deb</PRE>

<B><I>Tip:</I></B> To copy a file from your Ubuntu instance to your computer, 
you can use a script like this on your computer:<P>

<PRE>  scp -i myubuntu-1.pem ubuntu@ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx-xxxxx.compute.amazonaws.com:"$1" .</PRE>


<H3>Testing Free Pascal</H3>

On your Ubuntu instance, retrieve Part 3's example source code like this:<P>

<PRE>  curl --remote-name https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/28343282/MacXPlatform/p4g.zip</PRE>

Unzip this file in a subfolder under your home folder.<P>

You'll also need the Web Service Toolkit (WST) to compile Part 3's ndfd library, 
so first install Subversion:<P>

<PRE>  sudo apt-get install subversion</PRE>

Now change to a subfolder where you want to download the WST source and 
enter this:<P>

<PRE>  svn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/lazarus-ccr/svn/wst/trunk .</PRE>

Next change to the p4g example code's ndfd subfolder and compile the ndfd
library with FPC (adjust the -Fu path to point to your WST source):<P>

<PRE>  ppcx64 -CiroR -O2 -XX -Cg -k-fPIC -Fu~/Tools/WST -olibndfd64.so ndfd.pas</PRE>

To compile the examples below, you'll need to put the library somewhere that the
linker can find it. You can just copy it to /usr/lib like this:<P>

<PRE>  sudo cp -p libndfd64.so /usr/lib</PRE>

Now compile the example testndfd.pas console app:<P>

<PRE>  ppcx64 -Fu~/Tools/WST testndfd</PRE>

And test the console app:<P>

<PRE>  ./testndfd</PRE>


<H3>Testing the GDAL unit</H3>

First install GDAL. Since Ubuntu's default GDAL repository may be out-of-date, 
add this repository:<P>

<PRE>  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable && sudo apt-get update</PRE> 

Now install the GDAL/OGR programs and libraries:<P>

<PRE>  sudo apt-get install gdal-bin libgdal-dev</PRE>

Check to see what version of GDAL is installed by running one of the command-line
utilities:<P>

<PRE>  ogr2ogr --version</PRE>

Now change to the p4g example code's gdal subfolder and compile the example 
testgdal.pas console app:<P>

<PRE>  ppcx64 testgdal</PRE>

And run it:<P>

<PRE>  ./testgdal</PRE>

You should see the same version that ogr2ogr displayed.<P>


<H3>Testing Mono</H3>

Some version of Mono will already be installed on Ubuntu, but follow the steps on
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/linux/#debian-ubuntu-and-derivatives">www.mono-project.com</A>
for setting up the current versions of Mono and mono_mod. Then install the
current Mono:<P>

<PRE>  sudo apt-get install mono-runtime && sudo apt-get update</PRE>

Now change to the p4g example code's ndfd subfolder and compile the
C# wrapper class and testndfd.cs console app:<P>

<PRE>  ./comp-cs-interop.sh
  ./comp-cs.sh</PRE>

By default, these scripts use the /platform:x86 switch, which sets
the Ndfd.Interop.dll assembly's Corflags 32BIT flag, but Mono ignores this
.NET flag and still expects a 64-bit ndfd library. However, it will still 
look for libndfd.so, instead of libndfd64.so. You can change the comp-cs-interop.sh
script and add the /define:USE_64_BIT switch to change this behavior, 
but it's probably easier just to redirect via a symlink:<P>

<PRE>  sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libndfd64.so /usr/lib/libndfd.so</PRE>

Now you can run the test app:<P>

<PRE>  mono testndfd.exe</PRE>


<H3>Compiling AspCast</H3>

Retrieve the DotSpatial assemblies like this:<P>

<PRE>  curl --remote-name https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/28343282/MacXPlatform/DotSpatial_p4g.zip</PRE>

Unzip these files in the AspCast example's refs subfolder. Also copy the 
Ndfd.Interop.dll assembly to the refs subfolder.<P>

Now compile the AspCast ASP.NET Web app with Mono:<P>

<PRE>  xbuild AspCast.sln</PRE>

To prepare for deployment, zip up these files:<P>

<PRE>  zip aspcast Default.aspx
  zip aspcast ImageHandler.ashx
  zip aspcast Global.asax
  zip aspcast web.config
  zip aspcast Images/*.*
  zip aspcast Layers/*.*
  zip aspcast bin/*.*</PRE>


<H3>Deploying AspCast</H3>

First install Apache and mod_mono:<P>

<PRE>  sudo apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-mono</PRE>

Now deploy the AspCast files (substitute your folder for Tools):<P>

<PRE>  cd /var/www/html
  sudo mkdir aspcast
  cd aspcast
  sudo cp -p ~/Tools/p4g/AspCast/AspCast/aspcast.zip .
  sudo unzip aspcast.zip
  sudo rm aspcast.zip</PRE>

Make sure you've created the /usr/lib/libndfd.so symlink as described above.<P>

Also make sure Apache is running:<P>

<PRE>  sudo service apache2 restart</PRE>

Finally, on the EC2 Dashboard's Security Groups panel, edit the Inbound rules
for your Ubuntu instance's security group. By default it only allows SSH,
so you'll need to add HTTP (don't delete SSH).<P>

Now, in a Web browser back on your computer, paste your Ubuntu instance's public
DNS (from Instances panel) and add "/aspcast" to it (without quotes). Enter this 
URL and the AspCast app should appear in your browser.<P>


<H3>Testing Python</H3>

Python 2.7 and 3.4 interpreters will already be installed, but you'll need 
to install the Python libraries:<P>

<PRE>  sudo apt-get install libpython2.7-dev libpython3.4-dev</PRE>

Change to the p4g example code's ndfd subfolder and compile the Python
extension modules:<P>

<PRE>  ppcx64 -B -Cg -ondfdmod64.so ndfdmod.pas
  ppcx64 -B -Cg -dUSE_PYTHON3 -ondfdmod64_3.so ndfdmod.pas</PRE>
  
Test with both Python 2.7 and 3.4:<P>

<PRE>  python testndfd.py
  python3 testndfd.py</PRE>


<HR>
<A name="Windows"></A><H2>Windows server</H2>

Log into your AWS account, go to the EC2 Dashboard and create 
a Windows instance. You do this on the Instances panel by clicking Launch Instance 
and choosing an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that you want to use. The notes that 
follow assume you've selected a <B>Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Base</B> AMI.
Note that all AMIs are 64-bit.<P>

Once you launch the instance, you'll be prompted to create a public key and
download its private key file (.pem extension). You'll need this file to connect
to the instance from your computer.<P>

Next install a remote desktop client app on your computer. For example, on a Mac, 
download the Microsoft Remote Desktop app from the Apple App Store. Then follow
<A HREF="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/connecting_to_windows_instance.html">Amazon's instructions</A>
for connecting to your Windows instance.<P>

<B><I>Tip</I></B>: On a Mac, once you've downloaded the .rdp file, you can
double-click it to start Microsoft Remote Desktop and connect to your
Windows instance. But to customize your setup, you'll need to use File | Import
and select the .rdp file. Now you can edit the setup. For example, you can
turn off the default full screen mode and scale the Windows desktop to the size 
of the window on your Mac. You can also set up a shared folder on your Mac for 
copying files to and from your Windows instance.<P>


<H3>Installing and testing software</H3>

Because Windows Server 2012 provides a normal Windows desktop, you can install
and test software the same as you would on non-server Windows. The desktop
has the Windows 8 look, where the Start menu has been replaced by a kind
of start screen.<P>

To test Part 3's examples, you can download and install whatever software 
you need, including Free Pascal, Subversion (for retrieving Web Service Toolkit
source), Xamarin Studio, Python, etc. Note that .NET 4.0 is already installed.<P> 

If you need a text editor, Windows includes both Notepad and WordPad. Notepad
does not know how to handle text files with Unix-style line endings, 
but WordPad does.<P>

Windows Server includes something called PowerShell, but the familiar 
Command Prompt is also available.<P>

<B><I>Tip</I></B>: On a Mac laptop, use a two-finger click on the trackpad
to simulate a right-click. The normal control+click combination won't work 
in Windows.<P>


<H3>Compiling AspCast</H3>

You can compile and test AspCast with Xamarin Studio, as described in
<A HREF="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/28343282/MacXPlatform/PascalDynLibs_3.html#DotSpatial">Part 3</A>.
Be sure to copy the ndfd.dll library to the AspCast bin subfolder and
the DotSpatial and Ndfd.Interop.dll assemblies to the AspCast refs subfolder.<P>

To prepare for deployment, zip up these files:<P>

<PRE>  zip aspcast Default.aspx
  zip aspcast ImageHandler.ashx
  zip aspcast Global.asax
  zip aspcast web.config
  zip aspcast Images/*.*
  zip aspcast Layers/*.*
  zip aspcast bin/*.*</PRE>


<H3>Deploying AspCast</H3>

Follow <A HREF="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/install-WIMP.html">Amazon's instructions</A> 
for installing Microsoft's IIS Web server.<P>

Next create a subfolder named "aspcast" under C:\inetpub\wwwroot and unzip
the AspCast files in this subfolder.<P>

Finally, make sure you've done the following:<P>

<UL>
  <LI>In IIS Manager, under Sites, right-click aspcast and choose Convert to
  Application.<P>
  <LI>In IIS Manager, under Application Pools, create a new pool for aspcast
  and under the pool's Advanced Settings, change Enable 32-Bit Applications
  to True.<P>
  <LI>In IIS Manager, under IIS Authentication for aspcast, change 
  Anonymous Authentication from "Specific user" to "Application pool identity".<P>
  <LI>On the EC2 Dashboard's Security Groups panel, edit the Inbound rules
  for your Windows instance's security group. By default it only allows RDP,
  so you'll need to add HTTP (don't delete RDP).<P>
</UL>

Now, in a Web browser back on your computer, paste your Windows instance's public
DNS (from Instances panel) and add "/aspcast" to it (without quotes). Enter this 
URL and the AspCast app should appear in your browser.<P>


<H3>Deploying QxCast</H3>

<UL>
  <LI>In Server Manager, install CGI.<P>
  <LI>Copy getforecast.cgi, getforecast.exe, ndfd.dll and web.config to your 
      server (for example, to C:\inetpub\wwwroot\getforecast).<P>
  <LI>Follow the steps under Deploying AspCast above for getforecast.<P>
  <LI>In IIS Manager, under ISAPI and CGI Restrictions, add getforecast.cgi and
      check the "Allow extension path to execute" box.<P>
  <LI>Edit QxCast's config.json file and change the build-cgi job's URL to
      point to getforecast.cgi on your server, then run generate.py build-cgi.<P>
  <LI>Copy QxCast's build folder to your server under C:\inetpub\wwwroot and 
      rename it to qxcast.
</UL>

Now, in a Web browser back on your computer, paste your Windows instance's public
DNS (from Instances panel) and add "/qxcast" to it (without quotes). Enter this 
URL and the QxCast app should appear in your browser.<P>


<HR>
<A name="Misc"></A><H2>Misc. notes</H2>

<OL>
  <LI>If you stop your instance, its public IP address may change the next time
      you start it. Presumably when an instance is not running, its IP address 
      is returned to a pool of addresses that Amazon uses. You'll need to edit 
      any scripts that use the IP address. However, just rebooting the instance 
      does not change the instance's IP address.<P>

  <LI>In an instance's security group, you can specify whether inbound traffic
      is allowed from any IP address (0.0.0.0), a range of IP addresses, or
      even a specific IP address (eg, your local computer's). Keep in mind that
      if you limit SSH or RDP inbound traffic to a specific IP address,
      you may need to update the IP address if your ISP routinely changes 
      the IP address that you use. When editing the security group, you can
      choose "My IP" from the Source drop-down list to update the IP address
      to whatever you're currently logged into AWS with.<P>
      
  <LI>Instance time zones are set to UTC by default.<P>
</OL>
