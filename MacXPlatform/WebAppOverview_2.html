<A name="Introduction"></A><H2>Introduction</H2>

This article takes a simple JavaScript app, <B>QxMap</B>, and shows how to add a 
Pascal server app to it. QxMap can be customized to use your own locations
on the map via a simple JSON file rather than modifying the JavaScript code.
These locations will be passed to the server app, which returns data
for the locations to be displayed on the map.<P>


The key here is to focus on the Pascal server part and ignore for now the
client-side JavaScript that might seem strange to Pascal developers.
A side benefit of this approach is to minimize the potential frustration 
with something new by doing one step at a time:

<UL>
  <LI>Make sure your customized QxMap works without a server app.
  <LI>Make sure your server app works without a client app.
  <LI>Finally, combine the client with the server and make sure everything 
      still works.
</UL>

You can play with the QxMap app below. Or click 
<A HREF="../iApps/qxmap/index.html" TARGET='_blank'>here</A> 
to launch it in its own browser window (for example, to test on a 
mobile device).<P>

<OL>
<LI>Download the <A HREF="http://www.qooxdoo.org">qooxdoo SDK</A>. Unzip this
    anywhere you want.<P>

<LI>On Windows, make sure you have <A HREF="https://www.python.org">Python</A> 2.7 installed. 
    Mac and Linux systems will already have Python installed.<P>

<LI>Download the <A HREF="qxmap_src.zip">QxMap app's source</A>. Unzip this anywhere you want.<P>

<LI>Create your own JSON file of location data. Substitute this file for the
    example <B>locations.json</B> included with QxMap (in source/resource/qxmap).<P>

    The locations.json file included with QxMap looks like this:<P>
    <pre><code class="json">[{"name":"Ouray",     "lat":38.02, "lon":-107.67, "display":"Data goes here"},
 {"name":"Silverton", "lat":37.81, "lon":-107.66, "display":"Data goes here"},
 {"name":"Telluride", "lat":37.94, "lon":-107.81, "display":"Data goes here"}]</code></pre>

    The "display" strings are just placeholders for what will be ultimately
    be supplied by the server app. You can put anything you want there for use 
    in testing QxMap without a server app.<P>

<LI>Edit QxMap's <B>config.json</B> file and customize it for your own needs:<P>
  <UL>
  <LI>Change the <B>QOOXDOO_PATH</B> setting so it points to your qooxdoo SDK's location.<P>
  <LI>Edit the <B>app-settings</B> near the bottom of the file. For example,
      be sure to change the <B>mapCenterLat</B> and <B>mapCenterLon</B> settings so the
      map's center point is right for your locations. If the name of your
      locations JSON file is different, change the <B>locsJsonUrl</B> setting accordingly.
  </UL><P>

    The default app-settings look like this:<P>
    <pre><code class="json">    "app-settings" :
    {
      "environment" : {
        "appName"      : "QxMap",
        "appVersion"   : "0.1",
        "copyright"    : "",
        "description"  : "",
        "mapCenterLat" : 37.92, 
        "mapCenterLon" : -107.74,
        "mapZoomLevel" : 10,
        "locsJsonUrl"  : "resource/qxmap/locations.json",
      }
    },</code></pre>

    Note that you can edit the config.json file in Lazarus by opening the <B>qxmap.lpi</B>
    project file (in source/class/qxmap).<P>

<LI>Generate your own QxMap app by entering this at the command line in the folder
    where config.json is located:<P>

    <pre><code class="bash">python generate.py source-dropbox</code></pre>

    This will generate a version of QxMap that doesn't call a server app. This type of
    simple app can be posted anywhere on the Web, including a free Dropbox 
    account (hence the job name).<P>

    Note that if you have the <A HREF="https://sourceforge.net/projects/qxotica">Qx_Proj</A> 
    package installed in Lazarus, you can open the qxmap.lpi project in Lazarus
    and choose Run | Compile to run the generate.py script.<P>

<LI>To test QxMap, double-click the <B>index.html</B> file in QxMap's source folder
    to open it in your browser.<P>

<LI>Write your Pascal server app. See below for what this server app
    needs to do.<P>

<LI>Create a version of QxMap that calls your Pascal server app by running 
    generate.py with the <B>source-cgi</B> job. You can test this version
    locally against your server app.<P>

<LI>Create a version of QxMap for deployment by running generate.py with the
    <B>build-cgi</B> job.<P>
    
    You can zip up the QxMap files that need to be deployed by entering 
    this at the command line in the folder where config.json is located:<P>
    
    <pre><code class="bash">zip -r build build</code></pre>
    
    Once unzipped on your server, you can rename the build folder to your
    app's name.

</OL>


<HR>
<A name="PascalServer"></A><H2>The Pascal Server App</H2>

QxMap will call the server app and pass the latitude and longitude of your
locations as named query parameters. For example, with the example locations, 
the query string passed to the server app would look like this:<P>

<pre><code class="bash">lat1=38.02&amp;lon1=-107.67&amp;lat2=37.81&amp;lon2=-107.66&amp;lat3=37.94&amp;lon3=-107.81</code></pre>

All your server app has to do is return data in JSON format for the specified locations.
For example, here is what the
<A HREF="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/28343282/MacXPlatform/PascalDynLibs.html">Pascal for GIS</A>
<B>getforecast</B> app might return for these locations (with line breaks 
inserted for readability):

<pre><code class="json">[{"point":"1","high":"67","low":"36","display":"High: 67 Low: 36"},
 {"point":"2","high":"52","low":"34","display":"High: 52 Low: 34"},
 {"point":"3","high":"53","low":"37","display":"High: 53 Low: 37"}]</code></pre>

The "display" field is the only required data; that's what QxMap will look
for in the returned JSON and what it will display on the map for each location.

<H3>A slight complication</H3>

In order to make cross-domain calls, QxMap actually makes a 
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP">JSONP</A> request, passing
along an extra "callback" parameter that the server app needs to look for. 
If present, the server app "wraps" the returned data with this parameter. 
For example, here is what the JSONP request might look like:<P>

<pre><code class="bash">lat1=38.02&amp;lon1=-107.67&amp;lat2=37.81&amp;lon2=-107.66&amp;lat3=37.94&amp;lon3=-107.81&amp;callback=qx.bom.request.Jsonp.qx1474502452269303.callback</code></pre>

And here's what the returned data would look like (again, with line breaks 
inserted for readability):<P>

<pre><code class="json">qx.bom.request.Jsonp.qx1474502452269303.callback(
[{"point":"1","high":"67","low":"36","display":"High: 67 Low: 36"},
 {"point":"2","high":"52","low":"34","display":"High: 52 Low: 34"},
 {"point":"3","high":"53","low":"37","display":"High: 53 Low: 37"}]);</code></pre>

<H3>Pascal CGI units, etc.</H3>

You can write your Pascal server app using whatever CGI or other units you want,
as long as it does what is outlined above.<P>

For example, the <A HREF="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/28343282/MacXPlatform/PascalDynLibs.html">Pascal for GIS</A>
<B>getforecast</B> app uses the abandoned ExtPascal project's FCGIApp unit.
The source for getforecast is <A HREF="p4g.zip">here</A> if you want to look
at it. The source for the FCGIApp and related units is <A HREF="fcgiapp_pkg.zip">here</A>.<P>

You can compile these source files as follows:<P>

<pre><code class="bash">lazbuild fcgiapp_pkg.lpk
lazbuild cgigateway.lpi
lazbuild getforecast.lpi
</code></pre>

Note that your Pascal app does not need to return weather forecast data the
way getforecast does. Any data associated with specific locations that changes 
regularly would probably be a good candidate for displaying with QxMap.

<H3>Deploying</H3>

QxMap's config.json file exports four "jobs" that you use with
generate.py to specify which version of QxMap you want to generate. 
Here's what they look like:<P>

<pre><code class="json">    "source-dropbox" :
    {
      "extend" : ["source", "app-settings", "ol-debug", "osm-stamen"],
      "environment" : {
        "getDataUrl" : ""
      }
    },

    "build-dropbox" :
    {
      "extend" : ["build", "app-settings", "ol-deploy", "osm-stamen"],
      "environment" : {
        "getDataUrl" : ""
      }
    },

    "source-cgi" :
    {
      "extend" : ["source", "app-settings", "ol-debug", "osm-stamen"],
      "environment" : {
        "getDataUrl" : "http://yourdomain.com/getforecast/getforecast.cgi"
      }
    },

    "build-cgi" :
    {
      "extend" : ["build", "app-settings", "ol-deploy", "osm-stamen"],
      "environment" : {
        "getDataUrl" : "../../getforecast/getforecast.cgi"
      }
    }</code></pre>

Use the <B>source-dropbox</B> job to generate a version of QxMap for testing locally
without calling a server. Use the <B>build-dropbox</B> job to generate a version
of QxMap to deploy to Dropbox (or other site).<P>

Note that the Dropbox jobs don't specify a server app URL in the <B>getDataUrl</B>
setting. However, you <I>can</I> call a server from a Dropbox deployed QxMap as long
as it communicates over <B>https</B>, not <B>http</B> (since Dropbox sites are https). 
For a more in-depth explanation, see 
<A HREF="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content">this</A>.<P>

Use the <B>source-cgi</B> job to generate a version of QxMap for testing locally
that calls the server app. Use the <B>build-cgi</B> job to generate a version
of QxMap to deploy.<P>

For the source-cgi and build-cgi jobs, adjust the getDataUrl setting as needed.
With build-cgi's default getDataUrl, the assumption is that the server app
will be on the same server, relative to QxMap's directory. With source-cgi,
the full URL is needed.<P>


<HR>
<A name="OpenLayers"></A><H2>OpenLayers and Map Tile Servers</H2>

QxMap uses the <A HREF="http://openlayers.org">OpenLayers</A> JavaScript library
to draw the map. The config.json file includes settings for OpenLayers
as well:<P>

<pre><code class="json">    "ol" :
    {
      "environment" : {
        "olVersion"   : "3.18.2",
        "olCssUrl"    : "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/ol3/3.18.2/ol.css",
        "olMarkerUrl" : "http://openlayers.org/api/img/marker.png",
      }
    },

    "ol-debug" :
    {
      "extend" : ["ol"],
      "environment" : {
        "olJsUrl" : "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/ol3/3.18.2/ol-debug.js",
      }
    },

    "ol-deploy" :
    {
      "extend" : ["ol"],
      "environment" : {
        "olJsUrl" : "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/ol3/3.18.2/ol.js",
      }
    },</code></pre>

You can change these settings as needed, for example to use a newer version
of OpenLayers or to deploy the OpenLayers CSS and JavaScript files on your
own server. Note that the ol-debug.js file is somewhat larger than the ol.js
file because its whitespace has not been stripped out to minimize its size.
Normally when you deploy an app you would use the smaller ol.js to minimize
download time.<P>

OpenLayers can download map tiles from a variety of servers. By default,
QxMap uses <A HREF="http://maps.stamen.com/#terrain/12/37.7706/-122.3782">Stamen's terrain</A> map tiles. 
Stamen's map tile server is free to use.<P>

OpenStreetMap also provides map tile servers, but there are
<A HREF="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tile_usage_policy">restrictions</A> on their use.
However, you can test your QxMap with OpenStreetMap (and see how different
the map looks) by changing <B>osm-stamen</B> to <B>osm-mapnik</B> in the
appropriate job (for example, source-dropbox) and regenerating QxMap.<P>

To add a map tile server to config.json, just add a new job similar to
osm-stamen, which looks like this:<P>

<pre><code class="json">    "osm-stamen" :
    {
      "environment" : {
        "osmUrl" : "https://stamen-tiles.a.ssl.fastly.net/terrain/{z}/{x}/{y}.jpg",
        "osmAttribution" : "Map tiles by <a href='http://stamen.com'>Stamen Design</a>, under <a href='http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0'>CC BY 3.0</a>. Data by <a href='http://openstreetmap.org'>OpenStreetMap</a>, under <a href='http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright'>ODbL</a>."
      }
    },</code></pre>

Map tile servers typically support URL templates, where {z} is zoom level,
{x} is horizontal position, and {y} is vertical position of the desired tile.<P>
