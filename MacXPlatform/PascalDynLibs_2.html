<H1>Pascal Dynamic Libraries: More Than You Want To Know</H1>
<H2>Part 2: Passing Pointers and Strings</H2>
</CENTER>

<HR>
<H2>Under construction!</H2>

The example library code for Part 2 is finished, but the notes on passing
pointers and strings are still under construction. The notes for
<A HREF="PascalDynLibs_3.html">Part 3: GIS for Pascal</A>
<I>are</I> available, though, and use part 2's example library.<P>

So, if you want to use Part 2's <B>ndfd</B> library with 
Part 3's GIS examples,
just run the supplied script (.sh) or batch (.bat) files in the
ndfd subfolder of Part 3's <A HREF="p4g.zip">p4g.zip</A> to build the binaries 
that you'll need for the examples.<P>

<H3>Compiling the ndfd library</H3>

The <B>ndfd</B> library calls the 
<A HREF="http://www.usgovxml.com/DataService.aspx?ds=NDFD">National Digital Forecast Database</A> (NDFD)
REST service to retrieve weather forecast data, so you'll need an
HTTP client to compile the library. Unfortunately, Free Pascal's HTTP client
does not work with NDFD's new HTTPS protocol, so you'll need to use another 
client, such as Indy, Synapse or, on Mac, the Foundation-based NS client 
(<A HREF="https://macpgmr.github.io/ObjP/nsunits-src.zip">nsunits-src.zip</A>).<P>

Run the appropriate script and specify the HTTP client to use and the location
of its files. Use one of the following defines on the script command line:<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Indy: -dUseIndyHttpClient
  <LI>Synapse: -dUseSynapseHttpClient
  <LI>Foundation (Mac): -dUseNSHttpClient
</UL>

For example, to compile the library on a Mac, using the Foundation-based HTTP
client, enter something like this (adjust the path as needed):<P>

<PRE>./comp-fpc-lib.sh -dUseNSHttpClient -Fu~/Tools/nsunits-src</PRE><P>

Another example, to compile the library on Windows, using Indy, enter something
like this (adjust the path as needed):<P>

<PRE>comp-fpc-lib.bat -dUseIndyHttpClient -FuC:\Tools\indy</PRE><P>

Note that Indy and Synapse require the OpenSSL libraries to communicate with 
sites that use the HTTPS protocol. On Mac and Linux, these libraries are already 
installed, but on Windows you'll need to obtain them yourself and place them 
somewhere on the path on in the same directory as the NDFD library. You can 
download them from <A HREF="http://indy.fulgan.com/SSL">here</A>.<P>

<H3>Using the NDFD SOAP service (optional)</H3>

You can also use NDFD's SOAP service if you're interested in that. To compile
the library, you'll need to specify the -dUseNdfdSoap switch and you'll need 
the Web Service Toolkit (WST).<P>

You do have WST, right? If not, change to a folder where you want to put 
the WST source files and check them out like this:<P>

<PRE>svn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/lazarus-ccr/svn/wst/trunk .</PRE>

Documentation is here:  <A HREF="http://wiki.freepascal.org/Web_Service_Toolkit">http://wiki.freepascal.org/Web_Service_Toolkit</A><P>

For example, to compile the library on Mac or Linux, using Synapse and the
NDFD SOAP service, enter something like this:<P>

<PRE>./comp-fpc-lib.sh -dUseSynapseHttpClient -Fu~/Tools/synapse-trunk -dUseNdfdSoap -Fu~/Tools/WST</PRE>

<H3>Using the ndfd library</H3>

There are some other scripts or batch files you can run when you're ready
to use the ndfd library.<P>

For example, to use the ndfd library with Python, compile the Python extension 
module using one or more of these:<P>

<PRE>comp-fpc-pymod.sh
comp-fpc-pymod3.sh
comp-fpc-pymod.bat</PRE>

NdfdLib.pas is the Pascal wrapper class for the library. To use it with
Lazarus, compile this Lazarus package:<P>

<PRE>lazbuild ndfd_pkg.lpk</PRE>

To compile the .NET/Mono assembly that wraps the ndfd library, run one of
these:<P>

<PRE>comp-cs-interop.sh
comp-cs-interop.bat</PRE>

On Mac, you may prefer to work with the library as a framework. Once you've
compiled the library, you can run a supplied script to create a framework
for it:<P>

<PRE>create-framework.sh</PRE>
