<H2>Under construction!</H2>

The example library code for Part 2 is largely finished, but the notes on passing
pointers and strings are still under construction. The notes for
<A HREF="PascalDynLibs_3.html">Part 3: GIS for Pascal</A>
<I>are</I> available, though, and use part 2's example library.<P>

So, if you want to use Part 2's <B>ndfd</B> library with 
Part 3's GIS examples,
just run the various script (.sh) or batch (.bat) files in the
ndfd subfolder of Part 3's <A HREF="p4g.zip">p4g.zip</A> to build the binaries 
that you'll need for the examples.<P>

Note that you'll need to edit a couple of the scripts to point to the
location of the Web Service Toolkit source files.<P>

You do have WST, right? If not, change to a folder where you want to put 
the WST source files and check them out like this:<P>

<PRE>svn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/lazarus-ccr/svn/wst/trunk .</PRE>

Documentation is here:  <A HREF="http://wiki.freepascal.org/Web_Service_Toolkit">http://wiki.freepascal.org/Web_Service_Toolkit</A><P>

By default, the ndfd library will be compiled with FPC's HTTP client, but
WST also supports Synapse, Indy and NS (OS X Foundation-based client). 
Just specify the appropriate switch and add a path to the source for the 
HTTP client you want to use in the appropriate scripts.
