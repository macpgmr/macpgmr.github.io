<a name="Introduction"></a><h2>Introduction</h2>

<a href="WebAppOverview.html">Part 1</a> discusses creating a Web app that uses 
the qooxdoo JavaScript framework for the app's user interface. These notes 
discuss writing a qooxdoo app in Pascal, using the Free Pascal "transpiler" to
convert the Pascal to JavaScript instead of writing the JavaScript directly.<p>

The rest of the qooxdoo development process remains the same, with the only
difference being how the required JavaScript is created.<p>
<hr>


<a name="SettingUp"></a><h2>Setting up</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Download the <a href="https://www.qooxdoo.org">qooxdoo SDK</a>.
      If you prefer to use the development version of qooxdoo, you can download
      a .zip from the <a href="https://github.com/qooxdoo/qooxdoo">qooxdoo GitHub</a>
      repository.<p>

      Unzip this file anywhere you want; no installation is needed.<p>

  <li>On Windows, make sure you have <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a> 2.7 installed. 
      Mac and Linux systems will already have Python installed.<p>

  <li>Sass is used by qooxdoo to create CSS files. You may already have Ruby Sass
      installed; if not, get it from <a href="https://sass-lang.com/ruby-sass">here</a>.<p>

      On Windows you may need to first install Ruby. The small Ruby installer
      without Devkit from <a href="https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/">here</a>
      is sufficient.<p>
      On Linux, you can install Sass directly with this: sudo apt-get install ruby-sass<p>

  <li>Download the <a href="http://wiki.freepascal.org/pas2js">Pas2JS</a>
      compiler (transpiler) and RTL from
      <a href="ftp://ftpmaster.freepascal.org/fpc/contrib/pas2js">here</a>.<p>

      Unzip this file anywhere you like; no installation is needed.<p>

  <li>Download the PnJ .zip from
      <a href="https://macpgmr.github.io/MacXPlatform/pnj.zip">here</a>.
      This includes Pascal interface units for the qooxdoo classes.<p>

      Unzip this file anywhere you like; no installation is needed.

<a name="SimpleApp"></a><h2>A simple app</h2>

Here are the steps for manually creating a simple mobile app that has a single
page:<p>

<ol>
  <li>Use the qooxdoo script to create the app directory and structure.
      In a terminal, change to where you want to create the directory and
      enter something like this (substitute the path to your qooxdoo directory):<p>

      <pre><code class="bash">python ~/Tools/qooxdoo-5.0.2-sdk/tool/bin/create-application.py --name=simple --type=mobile</code></pre><p>

      This will create a qooxdoo mobile app and directory named <b>simple</b>.
      (The source for this app is also included in the PnJ .zip.)<p>

      If you have the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/qxotica">qxotica</a>
      package installed in Lazarus, you can also use File | New to create the
      qooxdoo app.<p>

  <li>Delete the generated JavaScript files. Since you'll be generating
      JavaScript from Pascal, you don't need these files that qooxdoo
      created. In the app's source/class/simple directory, delete everything
      that's there. (If you created the app with Lazarus, you can retain
      the Lazarus project file simple.lpi.)<p>

      If you have npm installed, the current version of qooxdoo (5.0.2) will
      also create Gruntfile.js, package.json, package-lock.json, and 
      node_modules in the top level of the app's directory. You can delete these
      as well. If you're using the trunk version of qooxdoo, these files won't 
      be created.<p>

  <li>Create <b>Application.pas</b> in source/class/simple with any text
      editor. Copy and paste this code:<p>
      <pre><code class="delphi">program Application;

uses
  JS,
  qx.ui.mobile,
  MainPage;

var
  manager   : TPage_Manager;
  aMainPage : TMainPage;
begin
  manager := TPage_Manager.New(False);

  aMainPage := TMainPage.New;

  manager.addDetail(aMainPage);

  aMainPage.show(nil);
end.
</code></pre><p>

      This code is pretty simple: create a page manager and the main page,
      add the page to the manager, show the page.<p>

  <li>Create <b>MainPage.pas</b> in source/class/simple. Copy and paste
      this code:<p>
      <pre><code class="delphi">unit MainPage;

interface

{$modeswitch externalclass}

uses
  JS,
  qx,
  qx.ui.mobile;

type
  TMainPage = class external name 'simple.MainPage' (TPage_NavigationPage)
  end;


implementation

procedure Construct;
begin
  TMainPage(JSThis).base(JSArguments, nil);  //call ancestor's constructor
  TMainPage(JSThis).setTitle('Simple App');
end;


procedure Initialize;
begin
  TMainPage(JSThis).base(JSArguments, nil);  //call ancestor's method
end;


procedure Destruct;
begin
end;


initialization

  TQx_Class.define('simple.MainPage',
    new(['extend', TPage_NavigationPage,

         'construct', @Construct,

         'events',
           new([]),

         'properties',
           new([]),

         'members',
           new(['_initialize', @Initialize]),  //override

         'destruct', @Destruct]));

end.
</code></pre><p>

      Because JavaScript is not an OOP language, qooxdoo introduces its own
      system for adding OOP to JavaScript, using a "closed form" of
      class declaration. You can read more about that 
      <a href="https://www.qooxdoo.org/current/pages/core/oo_introduction.html">here</a>
      if you're interested. Instead of declaring the class's structure,
      the class is defined completely by calling
      <a href="http://www.qooxdoo.org/current/api/#qx.Class">define</a>.
      In the example code, this is done in the unit's initialization section
      to ensure that the class is defined before it's used.<p>

      Note how the class is also declared as an external class at the top of
      the unit. Since everything has to be declared in Pascal, this is needed 
      so the class's inherited methods can be referenced in Application.pas.<p>

      The define call illustrates two language features that are used routinely
      in JavaScript and qooxdoo. The first is the JavaScript
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object">object</a>
      (or "map" in qooxdoo terminology). Anytime you need to pass a group of 
      key-value pairs in JavaScript, you use an object ( {} ). You can create
      a JavaScript object in Pascal with the
      <a href="http://wiki.freepascal.org/pas2js#Create_simple_JS_objects_with_the_new_function">new</a>
      function. In this example, a map of six keys is passed to define.<p>

      The other recurring JavaScript language feature is 
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions">anonymous functions</a>,
      useful for on-the-fly function declarations. With qooxdoo, this allows 
      the function's code to appear immediately after the key it's associated with. 
      Since Pas2JS does not support anonymous functions, the example code uses 
      named functions Construct, Initialize and Destruct.<p>

      The Construct and Initialize procedures show how to work with another
      important JavaScript language feature: the
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this">this</a>
      keyword that's part of all functions and which qooxdoo uses to implement
      <a href="https://www.qooxdoo.org/current/pages/core/classes.html#inheritance">polymorphism</a>.
      JSThis is the Pas2JS equivalent, which is typecast to the type 
      (TMainPage) of the object passed to the function so the object's methods 
      can be called.<p>

  <li>Copy <b>RunMobileApp.js</b> from PnJ's packages/qooxdoo directory to
      the app's source/class/simple directory. Edit this file and change
      <b>myapp</b> to <b>simple</b> in two places. You can then forget about this
      little file. It's only needed to work around a chicken-and-egg problem
      when using the Pas2JS runtime with qooxdoo. See the comments in the
      file for more information.<p>

  <li>Compile the Pascal to generate Application.js. Create a script or batch 
      file, then copy and paste and edit this as needed:<p>
      <pre><code class="bash">#!/bin/sh
set -e

pas2jsdir=~/Tools/pas2js/bin
qxunitsdir=~/Tools/pnj/packages/qooxdoo

$pas2jsdir/pas2js -Jirtl.js -JiRunMobileApp.js -Jc -JoUseStrict- -Tbrowser -Fu$qxunitsdir Application.pas
</code></pre><p>

  <li>Generate the qooxdoo app. From the top level of the app directory, run
      the generate.py script:<p>
      <pre><code class="bash">python generate.py source</code></pre><p>

      The first time you run generate.py, it creates a cache; this may take a
      couple minutes, but subsequent runs will only take seconds. When complete,
      load index.html (in the app's source directory) into your browser to run 
      the app.<p>

      Note that if you created the app in Lazarus with qxotica, you can
      also run generate.py by opening simple.lpi in Lazarus and choosing 
      Run | Compile.<p>

      To generate a final deployment version:<p>
      <pre><code class="bash">python generate.py build</code></pre><p>

      This minimizes and obfuscates the app's JavaScript code and includes only
      the qooxdoo classes that the app uses. You can copy the contents of the 
      app's build directory to your Web server. No other files are needed 
      to deploy the app.<p>

      To generate the app from the example files supplied with PnJ, edit
      the simple app's config.json file and change QOOXDOO_PATH so it
      points to where you unzipped the qooxdoo SDK.<p>

<a href="WebAppOverview.html#qooxdoo">Part 1</a>
gives the JavaScript code for a qooxdoo version of the venerable Delphi
Fish Facts app. Here's the equivalent Pascal code. See the comments in the
JavaScript code given in Part 1 for more information about what the code is doing.

<a name="Future"></a><h2>Future developments</h2>

The previous notes describe what you can do today with Pas2JS and qooxdoo.
Here are some thoughts on where development might become more automatic and
streamlined in the future.<p>

<ol>
  <li>Lazarus trunk (1.9) has 
      <a href="http://wiki.freepascal.org/lazarus_pas2js_integration">some support</a>
      for Pas2JS integration that you can play around with if you've built the
      IDE yourself from trunk. The qooxdoo Pascal interface units include a 
      Lazarus package.<p>

  <li>Support for anonymous functions is a 
      <a href="http://wiki.freepascal.org/pas2js#Planned_language_features">planned language feature</a>
      for Pas2JS. Look at the number of places just in DetailPage.pas above 
      where this would be useful.<p>

  <li>The next major version of qooxdoo (6.0) should include a
      <a href="https://github.com/qooxdoo/qooxdoo-compiler">command line compiler</a>
      that will replace much of the current Python toolchain (generate.py, etc.).
      It includes its own copy of Sass too.<p>

  <li>The Pascal interface units for qooxdoo do not yet include all of the 
      qooxdoo classes. For example, qooxdoo also has a complete set of
      user interface controls for developing desktop Web apps. The mobile
      UI controls generally work fine in desktop browsers, but they are
      designed for smaller, mobile browsers. If your mobile 
      Web app doesn't look right in a desktop browser, try embedding it
      in an HTML embed tag, similar to what 
      <a href="WebAppOverview.html">Part 1</a> 
      does with the Fish Facts app (see the page's source).<p>
</ol>
<hr>


<a name="MiscNotes"></a><h2>Misc. notes</h2>
<ol>
  <li>A qooxdoo app that was generated by the "source" job includes
      a debugging console built-in, meaning you don't have to open the
      browser's console to see messages that you've output with
      console.log. Click and hold briefly on the app's title bar to
      open the debugging console.<p>

  <li>Note the naming of qooxdoo classes in the Pascal interface units.
      The Pascal convention of prefixing class names with "T" has been
      followed and the class names have been abbreviated from the actual qooxdoo 
      class names to make them less verbose. So qx.core.Object becomes
      TCore_Object, qx.ui.mobile.basic.Label becomes TBasic_Label,
      and so on. With a small number of classes this results in a somewhat
      vague class name. For example, qx.event.type.Event becomes
      TType_Event. Note that you can also include the class's unit name
      when specifying the type, for example, qx.event.TType_Event.<p>
      See the qooxdoo 
      <a href="http://www.qooxdoo.org/current/api/#qx">API viewer</a> 
      for documentation on all classes.<p>
