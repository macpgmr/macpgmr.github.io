<a name="Introduction"></a><h2>Introduction</h2>

On macOS, <a href="https://mapbox.github.io/mapbox-gl-native/macos">Mapbox</a>
is a 64-bit framework. There are two ways you can use it with Pascal:<p>

<ul>
  <li>Xcode (what the Mapbox macOS SDK was designed for)<p>
  <li>Lazarus (64-bit Cocoa widgetset to use the framework, but any platform 
      can be used for map design)
</ul>

We'll start with Lazarus and cover Xcode in <a href="PascalAndMapbox_3.html">Part 3</a>.<p>

With Lazarus, you can use the <b>TMbMap</b> custom control, which wraps 
portions of the Mapbox framework. You can install and use this control in 
Lazarus on any platform, but it will display a map only in apps compiled 
with the 64-bit Cocoa widgetset.<p>
<hr>


<a name="SettingUp"></a><h2>Setting up</h2>

Here are the steps. If you're working on a non-Mac platform, you only have
to do steps 4 and 5.<p>

<ol>
  <li>Sign up for a Mapbox <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/pricing">account</a>. 
      This is free to start using.<p>

  <li>Download the Mapbox macOS SDK. These notes are based on work with the 
      version 0.6.1 SDK, which you can download from
      <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/releases/tag/macos-v0.6.1">here</a>.<p>

      Double-click the .zip and move the resulting <b>mapbox-macos-sdk-0.6.1</b> 
      folder anywhere you like.<p>

  <li>Download the macOS framework Pascal interface units (AppKit, etc.) from
      <a href="https://github.com/genericptr">here</a>.<p>

      Double-click the .zip and move the resulting <b>MacOS_10_10-master</b> 
      folder anywhere you like.<p>

  <li>Download the macOS "extras" .zip from
      <a href="https://macpgmr.github.io/ObjP/MacOS_10_10-extras.zip">here</a>.<p>

      Don't let the name fool you. On non-Mac platforms, this is just a
      dummy package that the custom control package requires.<p>

      Double-click the .zip and move the resulting <b>MacOS_10_10-extras</b>
      folder anywhere you like.<p>

      On Mac, copy the folder's files to the MacOS_10_10-master folder.<p>

  <li>Download the Pascal SDK for Mapbox from
      <a href="https://macpgmr.github.io/ObjP/mapbox-macos-pascal.zip">here</a>.<p>

      Double-click the .zip and move the resulting <b>mapbox-macos-pascal</b> 
      folder anywhere you like.
</ol>
<hr>


<a name="Installing"></a><h2>Installing in Lazarus</h2>

To add the TMbMap custom control to Lazarus, you compile a series of
packages.<p>

<ol>
  <li>Mac users with Lazarus IDE that was 
      <a href="https://macpgmr.github.io/MacXPlatform/UsingCocoaFromTrunk.html">built with 64-bit Cocoa</a>: 
      Copy <b>Mapbox.framework</b> from the
      mapbox-macos-sdk folder to your <b>/Library/Frameworks</b> folder.<p>

      Note that when rebuilt, this will link Lazarus to Mapbox.framework,
      so don't remove it without first uninstalling the mapbox_ctrls package.<p>

      All other users: Skip this step.<p>

  <li>In Lazarus, choose Package | Open Package File and select
      <b>macos_common_frameworks.lpk</b> in the MacOS_10_10-extras folder.<p>

      Click Compile, but don't install it.<p>

  <li>In Lazarus, choose Package | Open Package File and select
      <b>mapbox_framework.lpk</b> in the mapbox-macos-pascal folder.<p>

      Click Compile, but don't install it.<p>

  <li>In Lazarus, choose Package | Open Package File and select
      <b>mapbox_ctrls.lpk</b> in the mapbox-macos-pascal/mapbox_ctrls folder.<p>

      Click Compile, then click Install to rebuild Lazarus. Once Lazarus
      restarts, you'll see a Mapbox tab on the components palette.<p>
</ol>
<hr>


<a name="Using"></a><h2>Using the TMbMap custom control</h2>

In Lazarus, create a new project, then add a TMbMap control to the form.
Compile and run the app. When it appears, the map will be blank.<p>

For a 64-bit Cocoa app, look in the Console app's log. You'll see 
a message indicating that no access token has been specified.<p>

Sign in to your Mapbox <a href="https://mapbox.com">account</a> and create an
access token. Typically you'll create one for each project. That way, you can
delete or change a project's token without affecting any other projects.<p>

Now add this line of code to your project's <b>.lpr</b> source file (before the
first CreateForm line), substituting your access token (copy and paste):<p>

<pre><code class="delphi">TMbMap.SetAccessToken('your-access-token-goes-here');
</code></pre><p>

You'll also need to add the <b>MbMap</b> unit to the .lpr file's uses.<p>

Compile and run the app again. You should now see a map of the world.<p>

<h3>Map details</h3>

To have the map come up on a specified location, set the map control's 
Latitude, Longitude and ZoomLevel properties. For example, to zoom in on
the San Juan Mountains of southwest Colorado in the U.S. and display
a detailed map, use these values:<p>

<ul>
  <li>Latitude: 37.92
  <li>Longitude: -107.74
  <li>ZoomLevel: 9
  <li>StyleURL: mapbox://styles/mapbox/satellite-streets-v10
</ul>
<hr>


<a name="Deploying"></a><h2>Deploying your app</h2>

Your test app is currently loading the Mapbox.framework that you copied to
/Library/Frameworks. With an app that you deploy to other users, you'll
want to include Mapbox.framework in your app. Here's how to do that:<p>

<ol>
  <li>In Finder, control-click on your project's .app bundle and choose
      Show Package Contents.<p>
  <li>Create a folder named Frameworks in the Contents folder.<p>
  <li>Copy and paste Mapbox.framework from the mapbox-macos-sdk folder
      to your app's Frameworks folder.<p>
  <li>In Lazarus, copy and paste these linker switches into Custom Options in
      Project Options:<p>
      <pre><code class="bash">-k-F"'$ProjPath()$NameOnly($TargetFile()).app/Contents/Frameworks'"
-k-rpath
-k@executable_path/../Frameworks
</code></pre><p>
      This will link your app's executable to the app bundle's 
      Mapbox.framework (see <a href="https://www.manpagez.com/man/1/ld/">ld</a>)
      and indicates where to look for the framework at runtime (see
      <a href="https://www.manpagez.com/man/1/dyld/">dyld</a>).
      (Note -k-F is the same as FPC's -Ff switch.)<p>

      Now compile the app again.<p>
</ol>
<hr>


<a name="Example"></a><h2>BoxCast LCL: an example app</h2>

The source for BoxCast LCL, a more extensive example, is included in the
mapbox-macos-pascal folder. BoxCast LCL is a Lazarus version of the 
original Boxcast JavaScript app given
<a href="https://macpgmr.github.io/MacXPlatform/PascalDynLibs_3.html#Mapbox">here</a>.<p>

BoxCast LCL uses two additional .lpk packages, as well as the NDFD framework for
retrieving weather forecast data to display on the map. BoxCast LCL also
demonstrates how to do the following:<p>

<ul>
  <li>Add an event handler for when the map is double-clicked.
  <li>Call a dynamic library (in NDFD.framework), passing the double-clicked
      coordinates to retrieve weather forecast data for that location.
  <li>Add a point to the map at the double-clicked coordinates, labeling
      it with the retrieved data.
  <li>Save and load app state (map center, zoom level, etc.).
  <li>Display simple help for how to use the map.
  <li>Display the app version from the app's Info.plist file in the About box.
</ul>

If you want to compile and run BoxCast LCL yourself, here are the steps:<p>

<ol>
  <li>Edit BoxCast LCL's <b>accesstoken.inc</b> and substitute your own Mapbox access
      token.<p>

  <li>Compile LazXProj's <b>appxproj.lpk</b> package in Lazarus, but don't 
      install it. More information is
      <a href="https://macpgmr.github.io/MacXPlatform/LazXProj.html">here</a>.<p>

  <li>Open LazXProj's <b>fix_xproj.lpi</b> in Lazarus and compile it.<p>

  <li>Open <b>boxcast_lcl.lpi</b> in Lazarus and create the BoxCast LCL.app 
      bundle (in Project Options).<p>

  <li>Follow steps 1-3 in deploying section above.<p>

  <li>Create <b>NDFD.framework</b> and copy it to BoxCast LCL.app's Frameworks
      folder (alongside Mapbox.framework). Instructions for creating
      NDFD.framework are <a href="https://macpgmr.github.io/MacXPlatform/PascalDynLibs_2.html">here</a>.<p>

  <li>Compile the <b>ndfd_framework_pkg.lpk</b> package in Lazarus, but don't 
      install it.<p>

  <li>Open <b>boxcast_lcl.lpi</b> in Lazarus and run it.
</ol>

For other platforms, you can still compile and run this app, although the
map won't display. For non-Mac platforms, skip steps 4-6, but do
create the NDFD <i>library</i> (ndfd.dll or 
libndfd64.so) and copy it into the boxcast_lcl directory. With step 8, 
be sure to select either the <b>Mac non-64-bit Cocoa</b> or the <b>Non-Mac</b> 
build mode in Project Options, then compile and run.<p>
<hr>


<a name="MiscNotes"></a><h2>Misc. notes</h2>

<ol>
  <li>What about the possibility of a cross-platform TMbMap? Certainly the
      Qt5 widgetset would be a good possibility. You would need a library that
      wraps ("flattens") the Mapbox Qt SDK's C++ classes, similar to what 
      the Qt5Pas library does now for the Qt5 C++ classes (the Qt5Pas library 
      is used by the LCL Qt5 widgetset). Then you would need to implement 
      qtmbmap.pas for TMbMap (analogous to cocoambmap.pas). For an example 
      of a cross-platform custom control that has both Cocoa and Qt 
      implementations, see TWebBrowser (source is 
      <a href="https://macpgmr.github.io/MacXPlatform/lclwebbrowser-src.zip">here</a>).<p>

  <li>A benefit of a cross-platform custom control is how it simplifies and
      smooths the use of a disparate, alien library in a different setting,
      in this case Lazarus. For example, look at BoxCast LCL's 
      double-click handler. Nothing could be simpler or more Lazarus friendly:<p>
      
      <pre><code class="delphi">procedure TMainForm.MapDblClickMap(Sender    : TObject;
                                   Latitude  : Double;
                                   Longitude : Double);
begin
  if not Ndfd.LoadForecast(FloatToStr(Latitude, FmtSettings),
                           FloatToStr(Longitude, FmtSettings),
                           False) then
    begin
    MessageDlg('Unable to retrieve weather forecast data.', mtError, [mbOK], 0);
    Exit;
    end;

  Map.AddPointAnnotation(Latitude, Longitude,
                         'Today''s forecast',
                         'High ' + Ndfd.GetMaxTemp(1) +
                         ', Low ' + Ndfd.GetMinTemp(1));
end;
</code></pre><p>

      How this is implemented underneath is of little interest to the 
      user of the custom control. And in fact, the implementation can and will
      change as needed, for example to add support for additional platforms.<p>

      The big drawback of a custom control, though, is that it
      requires an enormous amount of work to wrap an entire library,
      involving countless decisions about implementation details and APIs,
      all the while trying to preserve the possibility of cross-platform 
      support.<p>

      It's no different with TMbMap and so only a tiny portion of the 
      underlying Mapbox library is currently wrapped by TMbMap. Part 3 
      will show how working directly with the Mapbox library in Xcode opens up 
      all of its functionality, although at the price of cross-platform code.<p>

  <li>Since the Mapbox framework requires at least macOS 10.10, you can add
      the <b>-WM10.10</b> switch in your project's Custom Options. That will
      override Lazarus's default of 10.5 for 
      <a href="https://www.manpagez.com/man/1/ld/">-macosx_version_min</a> with Cocoa.
      You can also set 
      <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/LaunchServicesKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001431-113253">LSMinimumSystemVersion</a> 
      in your project's Info.plist file to the same value, like this:<p>

<pre><code class="xml">    &lt;key&gt;LSMinimumSystemVersion&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;10.10&lt;/string&gt;
</code></pre><p>

  <li>Mapbox caches the imagery (tiles) it downloads. If you need to delete
      the cache for some reason (for example, to test how long a map takes to
      download), you can delete them. For example, the cached files for 
      BoxCast LCL are stored in <b>~/Library/Caches/com.junk.BoxCast-LCL</b>
      and <b>~/Library/Application Support/com.junk.BoxCast-LCL/.mapbox</b>.
      As with the app's preferences file name (~/Library/Preferences/com.junk.BoxCast-LCL.plist),
      the app's bundle ID is used to name the folders.<p>
