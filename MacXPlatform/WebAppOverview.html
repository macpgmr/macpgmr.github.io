<A name="Introduction"></A><H2>Introduction</H2>

A Web app typically consists of two parts: a client-side app of HTML and JavaScript 
that runs in the user's browser and a server-side app that can be developed with 
virtually any programming language. The two apps communicate with each other: 
the client app makes requests for data and the server app responds to the requests 
by returning data.<P>

With simple apps that don't need any code to be executed on the server,
you might be able to get away with developing only the client-side app, 
assuming you can write a bit of JavaScript. The entire app can then be
deployed from almost anywhere, including a Dropbox account.<P>

For example, here's the venerable Delphi <B>Fish Facts</B> demo app done as a Web app.
It's so simple it doesn't need a server-side app, just <B>index.html</B>,
<B>fishfacts.js</B>, a few <B>CSS</B> files, and the <B>biolife.json</B> and 
<B>.png</B> files containing the data and pictures it needs. Click a fish
in the list at the left to see its data and picture.<P>

(Note that the document you're reading was designed to be viewed in a desktop
browser. The app itself will adapt to any browser, mobile or desktop. If the
embedded app above doesn't look right in your mobile browser, click 
<A HREF="../iApps/fishfacts/index.html" TARGET='_blank'>here</A> to launch it 
in its own browser window.)

<A name="qooxdoo"></A><H2>The qooxdoo JavaScript Framework (and Lazarus)</H2>

The Fish Facts Web app was developed with the <A HREF="http://qooxdoo.org">qooxdoo</A>
JavaScript framework and the <A HREF="https://sourceforge.net/projects/qxotica">qxotica</A>
package for the <A HREF="http://www.lazarus-ide.org">Lazarus</A> IDE. Once 
added to the Lazarus IDE, you can create a qooxdoo app and its boilerplate code 
(just use File | New), as well as edit and check the syntax of the client app's 
JavaScript, all from within Lazarus.<P>

Here's what the Fish Facts <B>Application.js</B> code looks like as created
by qxotica from within Lazarus and used in the app without any modifications:<P>

<EMBED SRC="WebAppOverview_FFAppCode.html" TYPE="text/html" WIDTH=800 HEIGHT=300><P>

If you scroll down in the code, you'll see that it sets up a main page and
a detail page, as well as a "listener" function that responds to the selection
of a fish from the list and a function that responds to touching the Back button
on the detail page when run in a mobile browser.<P>

Here's the Fish Facts app's <B>MainPage.js</B> code. Starting with boilerplate
code created by qxotica in Lazarus, additional code was added to set up the
fish list and bind it to the data source:<P>

<EMBED SRC="WebAppOverview_FFMainCode.html" TYPE="text/html" WIDTH=800 HEIGHT=300><P>

Finally, here's the Fish Facts app's <B>DetailPage.js</B> code. Again, starting
with boilerplate code, additional code was added to lay out the page and bind
elements of the page to the data source:<P>

<EMBED SRC="WebAppOverview_FFDetailCode.html" TYPE="text/html" WIDTH=800 HEIGHT=300>

<A name="Server"></A><H2>Adding a Pascal Server App</H2>

When you choose Run | Compile with a qooxdoo project in Lazarus, it runs
qooxdoo's <B>generate.py</B> script to check the JavaScript syntax and generate
the files needed to test the app locally by opening its index.html file
in a browser. It does this by specifying the "source" job when it runs
generate.py.<P>

When you're ready to deploy the app, you can run the generate.py script
with the "build" job to combine your app's JavaScript with the qooxdoo
framework's JavaScript into a single .js file. The resulting "build" folder
can then be copied directly to your Web server.<P>

Typically a qooxdoo project will have additional custom jobs. For example, 
the <B>Unicodum</B> demo app included with the qxotica package includes the 
following jobs (defined in its config.json file):<P>

<UL>
<LI>source-usecgi
<LI>build-usecgi
<LI>source-usephp
<LI>build-usephp
</UL>

You specify a job to indicate which server URL to use. For example, if you specify
"source-usecgi", the app will use <B>http://localhost/cgi-bin/cgigateway.cgi</B>
so you can test it locally. If you specify "build-usecgi" when you're ready 
to deploy, the app will use the URL of your actual Web server (also defined
in the config.json file). The "usephp" jobs indicate to use the PHP server app 
rather than the Pascal FCGI app.<P>

Since a qooxdoo client app doesn't "know" anything about the server app and 
the server app doesn't "know" anything about the client app making the requests
for data, it's easy to switch between different server apps. The only
requirement would be that they return the same data.<P>

For example, here's the Pascal source for the main unit of the <B>getunicode</B>
FCGI server app:<P>

<EMBED SRC="WebAppOverview_GetUniPasCode.html" TYPE="text/html" WIDTH=800 HEIGHT=300><P>

Scrolling down in the code, you can see that the app does only two things:
if it receives the "blocks" query it returns JSON for the list of Unicode
code blocks; if it receives a query of the form block=xxx, it returns JSON
for the specified block's Unicode characters. All data is obtained from
a Sqlite database on the server and converted to a JSON array.<P>

Connecting the JavaScript client app's UI to the server app is the same as
it was in Fish Facts. In Fish Facts, the code binds the UI elements to the
URL of a JSON file on the server; in Unicodum, the code binds the UI elements
to the URL of a server app that returns JSON. The code looks almost the 
same. For example, here's the code that binds the master page's list of blocks
to the server app (compare it the code in MainPage.js above):<P>

<EMBED SRC="WebAppOverview_UniSnippetCode.html" TYPE="text/html" WIDTH=800 HEIGHT=270><P>


<HR>
<A name="Non-visual"></A><H2>Non-visual UI Design</H2>

Here's a screenshot of the Fish Facts project's DetailPage.js file opened 
in the Lazarus code editor:<P>

<IMG src="WebAppOverview_LazCodeEditor.jpg" hspace="10" border="1" alt="[Image] goes here"><P>

The code shown in the editor lays out the fish's picture and its two 
lengths (inches and centimeters). Note how there are no pixel values used
to specify the location and size of the Image and Label controls used.<P>

Instead, the three controls are laid out as follows: The labelLengthIn and
labelLengthCm controls are added to a vertical "container" control (container2).
Then the image control and container2 are added to a horizontal control
(container3). Finally, container3 is added to the page itself. The result
is the layout you see in the Fish Facts app above.<P>

Note that you can use pixel settings if necessary. Typically you would add
these as styles to the app's CSS. For example, in the above code, a couple of
non-breaking spaces are prefixed to the HTML returned for the length labels
to set off the labels from the picture. If you need something more precise 
than this, you could try creating a style with a margin-left property and 
assign it to the label controls via the control's addCssClass method.<P>

Somewhat paradoxically, this kind of "non-visual" UI design often results
in a better overall look, since it allows the controls to position and resize
themselves "naturally", flowing and filling in the available space on
whatever mobile or desktop browser is used to run the app.<P>
