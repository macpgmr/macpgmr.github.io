These notes describe how to share files with an iOS app, as well
how to open and edit those files. The provided example app is a simple file 
viewer and editor that touches on a variety of technologies, including the 
following:<P>

<UL>
<LI>iOS file directories and file access
<LI>iTunes, Mail, Dropbox
<LI>Defining your app's file types
<LI>Free Pascal's XML units
<LI>UISegmentedControl
<LI>A new NSHelpers string-conversion unit
<LI>Opening a file when asked
<LI>Saving and restoring program state

When you install an app from the App Store, the app's "home directory" and
several subdirectories get created on your iOS device. The same thing happens 
when you build and run an app in Xcode - the app gets installed in iOS Simulator 
or on an iOS device. These directories are illustrated in the figure below.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 5-1. Contents of an iOS app's home directory.<P>
<IMG src="ObjP_Part5-1.jpg" hspace="10" align="left" /><P>

Documents - create files here that you want the user to see in iTunes; user
can also copy files to and from Documents in iTunes.<BR>

Library - create files here that you don't want the user to see in iTunes.<BR>

Caches - create support files here that should persist between launches of the app.<BR>

Preferences - store app preferences and program state here.<BR>

Test4 - the app bundle (see below).<BR>

tmp - create temporary files here.<BR>

<BR clear="all"><P>

Note that files in the Documents, Library and Preferences subdirectories are 
backed up by iTunes when you sync the device. And when you install an update,
the Documents and Library contents are copied to the new application 
directory.<P>

An iOS app bundle is similar to an OS X app bundle, as shown in the two figures
below. Since the app is code-signed on an actual iOS device, its bundle has  
several additional files.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 5-2. Contents of app bundle in iOS Simulator.<P>
<IMG src="ObjP_Part5-2.jpg" hspace="10" /><P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 5-3. Contents of app bundle on iOS device.<P>
<IMG src="ObjP_Part5-3.jpg" hspace="10" /><P>

Since the app bundle on an iOS device is code-signed, you can't write
to that directory, although you can open files there read-only (for example,
additional files that you distribute with your app). In addition, your
app can't read or write other apps' files; nor can other apps read
or write your app's files.<P>

It's normal to "sandbox" users on the same computer, as well to restrict
user access to system files, but separating apps like this might take some 
getting used to. On most platforms you normally use a variety of apps
to create, delete, move and copy files, whether that be with Finder, a text
editor, IDE, etc. The implication of sandboxing is that this is not the
way you work with files on an iOS device. So how do you do those sorts 
of things?<P>

<HR>

<A name="Sharing Files"></A><H2>Sharing Files</H2>

You can think of your computer's iTunes app as kind of a Finder substitute
for your iOS device. Once you've added the <B>UIFileSharingEnabled</B> key 
to your app's Info.plist file and set it to YES, you can connect your device 
to your computer, select the device in iTunes, then click the Apps tab and 
scroll down to the bottom of the iTunes window. Here you'll see a list of 
all apps on your device that can share their Documents files with your 
computer via iTunes. This is also where you can copy files to and from 
your device and delete files from the device. (<B><I>Tip:</I></B> Dragging 
a file to the Trash doesn't work in iTunes. Instead, select the file and 
press the Delete key.)<P>

iTunes is fine when your computer is handy, but what if you only have your
device? In that case, you can use either e-mail or a free service like
<A HREF="https://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</A> to copy files to your device
and then to your app.<P>

In Mail, you can select a file attachment and touch the Open In button. Mail
will then display a list of apps that can open that file. Similarly, in 
Dropbox, you can select a file and touch the little button with the arrow.
Dropbox will then display a list of apps that can open that file.<P>

So how do Mail and Dropbox know that your app can open a particular file?
You tell these (and other) apps about what types of files your app can 
open via its Info.plist file.<P>

For the example app, start by creating a new app in Xcode4 using the Objective
Pascal project template for a Window-Based Application. Enter <B>Test4</B> for 
the Product Name, <B>Test4AppDelegate</B> for the App Delegate Class, and
select <B>iPhone</B> for the Device Family.<P>

Now open <B>Test4-Info.plist</B> in Xcode4 and add the <B>CFBundleDocumentTypes</B>
and <B>UTExportedTypeDeclarations</B> sections as shown in the figure below.
Use your own bundle identifier if it's different from com.myjunk. 
And be sure to add the UIFileSharingEnabled key as well.<P>

<B><I>Tip:</I></B> If you don't see the key names, right-click and choose
<B>Show Raw Keys/Values</B> from the popup menu.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 5-4. Defining an app's file type.<P>
<IMG src="ObjP_Part5-4.jpg" hspace="10" /><P>

If you followed the example in <A HREF="ObjP_Part2.html">Part 2</A>, the 
<B>mydoc1</B> file extension should look familiar. In fact, the example app 
given in this article is essentially the mobile version of Part 2's Cocoa app. 
Once you have it running, you'll be able to work with files created by the 
Cocoa app. But first let's construct the app, which follows the familiar
Model-View-Controller (MVC) "design pattern".<P>

<HR>

<A name="TMyDocument Class"></A><H2>TMyDocument Class (the "model")</H2>

<I>"The model portion defines your application's underlying data engine and 
is responsible for maintaining the integrity of that data."</I>
<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/CoreApplication/CoreApplication.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH3-SW15">(iOS Application Programming Guide)</A><P>

If you refer back to Part 2, you'll see that the Cocoa document-based app
is implemented via the MyDocument subclass of NSDocument and the
MyWindowController subclass of NSWindowController. MyDocument's code uses an
NSXMLDocument object to read and write the .mydoc1 XML files. But
the iOS Foundation framework does not include the NSXMLDocument class, and its
suggested replacement, NSXMLParser, is an event-driven parser rather than a
tree-oriented parser. So to keep things simple, the mobile app uses 
Free Pascal's XML units to implement its TMyDocument class for reading and 
writing .mydoc1 files.<P>

The source for the MyDocument unit is <A HREF="MyDocument.pas">here</A>.
Place <B>MyDocument.pas</B> in the Xcode project's Test4 folder where the other 
source files are located. Once you've done this, you can right-click Test4 in 
the Project navigator list and choose Add Files to add MyDocument.pas to the
project if you want to be able to view it in Xcode.<P>

Note that TMyDocument is a normal TObject descendant rather than an NSObject
descendant. This means the MyDocument.pas unit can be compiled on any platform
that Free Pascal supports. Also, since Free Pascal's XML units accept and
return WideStrings, TMyDocument works with WideStrings too.<P>

Test the TMyDocument class by creating several .mydoc1 files that you'll use
later with the finished mobile app. For example, you can use a console app like 
below to create both an empty file and files with some data. You can also create
.mydoc1 files by running the Test2 app from Part 2.<P>

<PRE>
program CreateMyDoc;
uses
  MyDocument;
var
  XmlDoc : TMyDocument;
begin
  XmlDoc := TMyDocument.Create;
  XmlDoc.WriteToFile('empty1' + MyDocExt);
  
  XmlDoc.SetName('Some name');
  XmlDoc.WriteToFile('somedata1' + MyDocExt);

  XmlDoc.SetName('Another name');
  XmlDoc.WriteToFile('somedata2' + MyDocExt);

  XmlDoc.Free;
end.
</PRE>

<HR>

<A name="User Interface"></A><H2>User Interface (the "view")</H2>

<I>"The view portion defines the user interface for your application and has 
no explicit knowledge of the origin of the data displayed in that interface."</I>
<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/CoreApplication/CoreApplication.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH3-SW15">(iOS Application Programming Guide)</A><P>

In Xcode 4, drop three UILabels, a UISegmentedControl and a UITextField onto the
blank window and position and size them so they look something like the 
figure below, then change their settings as indicated.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 5-5. The example app's window layout.<P>
<IMG src="ObjP_Part5-5.jpg" hspace="10" align="left" /><P>
UILabel - set Text to "[File x of y]" and create an outlet named labelFileNum
(hint: drag its New Referencing Outlet to Test4AppDelegate.h).<P>
UILabel - set Text to "[No folder]" and create an outlet named labelFileFolder.<P>
UILabel - set Text to "[No file]" and create an outlet named labelFileName.<P>
UISegmentedControl<BR>
 - Set Segment 0's Title to "Previous" and Segment 1's Title to "Next".<BR>
 - Uncheck the Selected box for both segments and check the control's Momentary 
box - that way the control will look and act like two buttons rather than a 
switch.<BR>
 - Create an outlet named segPrevNext.<BR>
 - Create an action for the Value Changed event and name the receiving method
segValueChanged (hint: drag the Value Changed event to Test4AppDelegate.h).<P>
UITextField<BR>
 - Increase font size to 17.<BR>
 - Create an outlet named textFieldMyData.<BR>
 - Set Test4AppDelegate to be its delegate (hint: drag the UITextField's 
 delegate outlet to the yellow cube).
<BR clear="all"><P>

The layout is similar to what the user will see if Test4 can't find any files 
in Documents.<P>

In a real app you would probably use a UITableView to display a
list of files to choose from and a UINavigationController to create another
view where the actual editing takes place, but that's beyond the scope of this 
article. Instead, you'll use the Previous and Next buttons for moving from 
one file to another, displaying the current file's number, location, name and 
contents in simple controls on the main view.

<HR>

<A name="Test4AppDelegate Class"></A><H2>Test4AppDelegate Class (the "controller")</H2>

<I>"The controller portion acts as a bridge between the model and view and 
coordinates the passing of data between them."</I>
<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/CoreApplication/CoreApplication.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH3-SW15">(iOS Application Programming Guide)</A><P>

The complete source for the Test4AppDelegateU unit is <A HREF="Test4AppDelegateU.pas">here</A>.
You can either use this file to replace the default <B>Test4AppDelegateU.pas</B> 
file created by the project template or copy and paste its contents over the 
default code.<P>

The Test4AppDelegate class uses some routines from the NSHelpers string-conversion
unit. The source for the NSHelpers unit is <A HREF="NSHelpers.pas">here</A>.
Copy <B>NSHelpers.pas</B> into the project's Test4 folder with the other source 
files. You can also add it to the project if you want. If you want to use 
NSHelpers in other projects, you might consider compiling it the way you did
the iPhoneAll unit and placing NSHelpers.o and NSHelpers.ppu in the same 
locations as the iPhoneAll compiled files. (You can use the same compile-arm.sh 
script so that the compiled NSHelpers.o file contains both armv6 and armv7 code.)<P>

The Test4AppDelegate class is the most complicated part of the example app
and several of its methods merit some discussion.<P>

<UL>
<LI>application_didFinishLaunchingWithOptions<P>
This method is called when the app is launched. It gets the names of all files 
in the Documents directory and adds the names of all .mydoc1 files to a 
TStringList object it creates. It then gets the name of the file it had open the 
last time it was run (from the app's Preferences). Then it determines if the
file still exists and, if so, prepares to open it. However, if the app was 
launched as a result of a request to open a file that's been copied to the 
app's Inbox, it delays opening the last-used file.<P>

Note that iOS has a case-sensitive file system. Comparisons of file names
and extensions can be done with ordinary comparison operators (=, &lt;&gt;) rather
than with, say, the SameText function as you would on Windows.<P>

<LI>application_openURL_sourceApplication_annotation<P>
This method is called with the name of the requested file to open. It attempts
to move the file from the app's Inbox to its Documents directory. If successful,
it opens the file. If a file with the same name prevents the move, it deletes 
the file from the Inbox, displays an alert to the user, and opens the file the 
app would have opened if launched by the user.<P>

The Inbox directory (under Documents) is used as kind of a "staging" area.
Your app can move files from Inbox or delete them once it has copied them
elsewhere, but it can't create files in the Inbox directory.<P>

In a real app you would probably want to prompt whether it's okay to overwrite
the file or perhaps rename the file rather than just rejecting it the way
this method does.<P>

<LI>applicationDidEnterBackground<P>
This method is called when the app is about to enter the background state or
terminate. It saves the name of the currently open file in the app's 
Preferences directory so it can reopen the file the next time the app
is launched by the user.
</UL>

<HR>

<A name="Running the App"></A><H2>Running the App</H2>

Build and run the app in the iOS Simulator. You should see something that looks
like the user interface layout illustrated above.<P>

Now copy some .mydoc1 files into the Documents directory of where the app is
installed in the Simulator. On my system, it's located here:<P>

<PRE>
  ~/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/4.2/Applications/030FC85D-03C5-4BA0-B45F-BA13FAC4B7FB
</PRE>

This path indicates that the app was compiled with a deployment target of 
iOS 4.2. The long sequence of hex digits is the application ID and will be 
different on your computer.<P>

Now when you run the app in the Simulator you should see the number of files
you copied into Documents and the first file open in the app. If you edit the 
file's content, the change will be saved automatically when you move to a 
different file or press the Simulator's home button.<P>

Next build and run the app on an iOS device. Once you have it working, shut
down the app and copy one or more .mydoc1 files to the app's Documents
directory via iTunes.<P>

Finally, send a .mydoc1 file as an e-mail attachment or copy it into the
Dropbox folder on your computer, then try opening the file in your app
from Mail or Dropbox on the iOS device.<P>

The finished iOS app should look something like the figure below.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 5-6. The finished app.<P>
<IMG src="ObjP_Part5-6.png" hspace="10" border="1" /><P>

<HR>

<A name="A Few Words about Dropbox"></A><H2>A Few Words about Dropbox</H2>

The approach described above is simple - any file copied to a Dropbox folder
gets copied to the Dropbox server the next time the Dropbox client app is running
and the computer or device has Internet access. Once on the Dropbox server, 
the user can access the file on other computers and devices. 
However, this approach requires additional user steps to get a file to your 
app and doesn't provide a way to get a file <I>from</I> your app. 
(You could add to your app the capability to "open" a file in Dropbox 
similar to the way Dropbox "opens" a file in your app. Refer to the 
UIDocumentInteractionController class. To see how this works, open a Mail 
file attachment in Dropbox.)<P>

Dropbox does not share files via iTunes. Instead, Dropbox client apps
on OS X, iOS, Windows, etc. all use a "REST API over HTTP" to copy files
to and from the Dropbox server. Your app can use this API too and Dropbox
provides an Objective C SDK for that purpose. Your app would then be able to
copy files to and from the Dropbox server without user intervention. More 
information is <A HREF="https://www.dropbox.com/developers/docs">here</A>.<P>

Dropbox currently provides 2GB of space for free. This should be plenty if 
you're only using it to move files between computers and devices. If you need
more space, you can pay for it. Note that Apple's iCloud will likely provide 
similar services.<P>
