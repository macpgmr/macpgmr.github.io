<A name="Introduction"></A><H2>Introduction</H2>

These notes describe how to compile an Objective Pascal Cocoa Touch app with
the Free Pascal ARM cross-compiler and run the app on an actual iOS device. 
You should already have installed Xcode 4 and reviewed
<A HREF="ObjP_Part1.html">Part 1</A>, <A HREF="ObjP_Part2.html">Part 2</A>
and  <A HREF="ObjP_Part3.html">Part 3</A>.<P>

<HR>

<A name="Requirements"></A><H2>Requirements</H2>

<UL>
<LI>See Part 3 for basic requirements.<P>
<LI>Free Pascal cross-compiler version 2.6.2 for iOS ARM devices. An installer
is available here: <A HREF="ftp://freepascal.stack.nl/pub/fpc/dist/2.6.2/i386-macosx/">ftp://freepascal.stack.nl/pub/fpc/dist/2.6.2/i386-macosx/</A>.<P>
<LI>Compiled Pascal iOS headers. See next section.<P>

<OL>
<LI>You need to parse one additional header file (_struct.h) from the iOS SDK. 
The resulting Pascal file is needed to compile the Pascal runtime library for 
ARM. Jonas Maebe has provided a script to do this.<P>

In TextWrangler or other text editor, copy and paste the following lines, then 
save the file with a .sh extension (for example, make_sig_cpu.sh). If you 
checked out the FPC source to a different location, edit the first line.<P>

<B><I>Important!</I></B> The four lines that start with /usr/bin/gcc must
be on a single line in your script. The line is split up here into four lines 
for readability.<P>
<PRE>
FPCSOURCEDIR=/Developer/ObjectivePascal/fpc
IPHONESDKDIR=iPhoneOS4.3.sdk
IPHONEPLATFORMBASEDIR=/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer"
INCLUDEDIR="$IPHONEPLATFORMBASEDIR"/"SDKs/$IPHONESDKDIR/usr/include"
STRUCTSHEADER="$INCLUDEDIR"/arm/_structs.h

/usr/bin/gcc -I"$INCLUDEDIR" -E -D__need_mcontext_t -D__DARWIN_UNIX03 "$STRUCTSHEADER" | 
  sed -e 's/__uint32_t/cuint32/g' -e 's/_STRUCT_ARM_EXCEPTION_STATE/__darwin_arm_exception_state/' 
  -e 's/_STRUCT_ARM_THREAD_STATE/__darwin_arm_thread_state/' -e 's/_STRUCT_ARM_VFP_STATE/__darwin_arm_vfp_state/' 
  -e 's/__darwin_mcontext/mcontext_t/' > "$FPCSOURCEDIR"/rtl/darwin/arm/sig_cpu.h

/usr/local/bin/h2pas -i -o "$FPCSOURCEDIR"/rtl/darwin/arm/sig_cpu.inc "$FPCSOURCEDIR"/rtl/darwin/arm/sig_cpu.h
</PRE>

<LI>Run the parser script.<P>

First set the script to be executable:
<PRE>
chmod +x make_sig_cpu.sh
</PRE>

Then run it.
<PRE>
./make_sig_cpu.sh
</PRE>

This will create a small file, sig_cpu.inc. With the FPC checkout folder 
assumed above, the file will be created here:<P>
<PRE>
/Developer/ObjectivePascal/fpc/rtl/darwin/arm
</PRE>

<LI><B><I>Important!</I></B> Skip this step if you checked out
your Free Pascal source on Aug. 2, 2011 or later. If you've updated a
previously patched source, just delete the t_bsd.pas file mentioned below
and update again, then proceed to step 4.<P>

If you are compiling Free Pascal source checked out or updated prior to
Aug. 2, 2011, you also need to add one line to an FPC source file. This patch 
is needed because of a change in the Xcode 4 linker.<P>

Locate and open this file in TextWrangler or other text editor (substitute
your checkout folder if necessary):<P>

<PRE>
/Developer/ObjectivePascal/fpc/compiler/systems/t_bsd.pas
</PRE>

Locate this line and comment it out:<P>

<PRE>
LinkRes.Add('arm');
</PRE>

And insert this line below it:<P>

<PRE>
LinkRes.Add(lower(cputypestr[current_settings.cputype]));
</PRE>

<LI>Create the build script. In TextWrangler or other text editor, copy and 
paste the following lines, then save the file with a .sh extension (for example, 
make_arm.sh). If you checked out to a different location, edit the first line.<P>

Again, for readability, the last two lines have been split into two lines
here, but must not be split in your script file.<P>

<PRE>
cd /Developer/ObjectivePascal/fpc
export IPHONEPLATFORMBASEDIR=/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer
make FPC=/usr/local/lib/fpc/2.4.4/ppc386 CPU_TARGET=arm CROSSOPT="-FD${IPHONEPLATFORMBASEDIR}/usr/bin 
  -XR${IPHONEPLATFORMBASEDIR}/SDKs/iPhoneOS4.3.sdk/ -ap -Cfvfpv2" all
sudo make FPC=`pwd`/compiler/ppcrossarm OPT="-ap" CPU_TARGET=arm CROSSOPT="-FD${IPHONEPLATFORMBASEDIR}/usr/bin 
  -XR${IPHONEPLATFORMBASEDIR}/SDKs/iPhoneOS4.3.sdk/ -ap" install CROSSINSTALL=1
</PRE>

<LI>Run the build script.<P>

First set the script to be executable:
<PRE>
chmod +x make_arm.sh
</PRE>

Then run it, entering your password when prompted. The password is needed 
because we'll be installing the compiler in a place (/usr) that's normally 
read-only.
<PRE>
sudo ./make_arm.sh
</PRE>

This script will take a few minutes to complete since you're building not only
the compiler but also compiling the runtime units (SysUtils, Classes, etc.)
and CoreFoundation units (CFString, etc.). When complete, the compiler (ppcrossarm) 
will be installed in /usr/local/lib/fpc/2.5.1 and the compiled units will be 
installed in /usr/local/lib/fpc/2.5.1/units/arm-darwin.
To browse these files in Finder, choose Go | Go to Folder and enter /usr .<P>

<LI>Test the compiler.<P>
Copy and paste this to a Terminal command line to display the compiler's date,
version and target OS and processor:<P>
<PRE>
/usr/local/lib/fpc/2.5.1/ppcrossarm -iDVTOTP
</PRE>
</OL>

<A name="CompilingHeaders"></A><H2>Compiling Pascal iOS headers for ARM</H2>

In Part 3, you parsed the iOS headers to create the source for the iPhoneAll
unit and compiled the unit for use with the iOS Simulator compiler. Now you need 
to compile it for use with the ARM cross-compiler.<P>

<OL>
<LI>Change to the folder where the iPhoneAll source files are located. 
For example:<P>
<PRE>
cd /Developer/ObjectivePascal/utils/uikit-skel/src
</PRE>

<LI>Now compile the iPhoneAll unit:<P>

<PRE>
./compile-arm.sh iPhoneAll
</PRE>

Using the script included with the header parser ensures that the compiled
object (.o) files contain both armv6 and armv7 code.<P>

<LI>Copy the compiled files to where your project will look for them.<P>

The Cocoa Touch template assumes that the compiled iPhoneAll files for 
ARM are in the following location, although you can place them wherever you want 
and just edit the path in your project settings:<P>
<PRE>
/Developer/ObjectivePascal/units/arm-darwin
</PRE>

Here are the files you need to copy:<P>
<PRE>
iPhoneAll.o
iPhoneAll.ppu
AnonClassDefinitionsUikit.o
AnonClassDefinitionsUikit.ppu
</PRE>
</OL>

<A name="ProvisioningProfile"></A><H2>Obtaining a provisioning profile for your app</H2>

Creating a provisioning profile may seem confusing at first, but all you're 
doing is tying together three things: a developer, a device and an app. 
Requiring a provisioning profile helps protect the user from malware and helps 
protect you from getting ripped off by software pirates.<P>

<B><I>Tip:</I></B> The following steps describe how to <I>manually</I> create
and download a profile. For many apps you can also let Xcode do <I>automatic</I>
provisioning. For more information, see 
<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/ToolsLanguages/Conceptual/Xcode4UserGuide/Devices/Devices.html">Apple's docs</A>.<P>

<OL>
<LI>Log into the iOS Dev Center. Note you must be a iOS Dev Center member
to log in.<P>

<PRE>
<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action">http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action</A>
</PRE>

<LI>Click the iOS Provisioning Portal link.<P>

<LI>If you haven't done this previously for yourself, obtain an iOS Development 
Certificate.<P>

<LI>If you haven't done this previously for your iOS device, obtain a Device ID.<P>

<LI>Create an App ID for your app.<P>

<UL>
<LI>For the Description, enter the name of your Cocoa Touch project. For example, 
with the Part 3 example project, enter <B>Test3</B>.<P>

<LI>For the Bundle Identifier, just open your project in Xcode and look in your
project-Info.plist file to see what to use for the first part of the identifier. 
For example, if it starts with "com.mycompany", enter <B>com.mycompany.Test3</B>
as the Bundle Identifier.<P>
<LI>Click Submit.<P>
</UL>

<LI>Create a new Provisioning Profile.<P>
<UL>
<LI>For Profile Name, enter a name for the profile, for example <B>ObjP_Test3</B>.<P>
<LI>For Certificates, check your name.<P>
<LI>For App ID, select the App ID you created in the previous step.<P>
<LI>For Devices, check your device that you want to run the app on.<P>
<LI>Click Submit.<P>
</UL>

<LI>Download the provisioning profile.<P>

<UL>
<LI>On the Provisioning page, you'll see your new profile listed, followed by 
"Pending". After a minute or two, the status will change to "Active".<P>
<LI>Click Download. This will download your provision's file, for example
<B>ObjP_Test3.mobileprovision</B>.<P>
</UL>

<LI>You can now log out of the iOS Dev Center.<P>
</OL>

<A name="RunningApp"></A><H2>Running your app on an iOS device</H2>

<OL>
<LI>Open your project in Xcode.<P>
<LI>If you manually created a profile, drag and drop the downloaded provision 
file onto Xcode's icon on the Dock. 
This will bring up Xcode's Organizer, where you should see the provisioning 
profile listed.<P>
<LI>In Xcode, check the ARCHS setting on the target's Build Settings tab 
to make sure you're compiling for the desired architecture(s). By default
the template sets ARCHS to <B>armv6</B>. If you're targeting iOS 5 or later, 
change ARCHS to <B>armv7</B> since all devices running iOS 5 can run armv7 code. 
You can also set ARCHS to <B>armv7 armv6</B> to include code for both 
architectures in the same "universal" binary.<P>
<LI>Connect your iOS device to your Mac and unlock it by entering the 
device's access code.<P>
<LI>In Xcode, select your device from the Scheme list, then choose 
Product | Build to make sure Xcode can compile your app with the FPC ARM 
cross-compiler.<P>
Note: If you only see the generic iOS Device in the Scheme list, this probably 
means there's a mismatch somewhere. For example, make sure your device's version 
of iOS is equal to or greater than your project's deployment target.<P>
<LI>Choose Product | Clean, then Product | Run. Xcode will now build and 
copy the app to your device and run it. The screenshot below shows what
it should look like on an iPhone or iPod touch.<P>

<A name="BuildLog"></A><H2>Reviewing the build log</H2>

This illustration shows a typical build log for the example app
given in Part 3. Discussion follows below.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 4-2. The Xcode 4 build log for an Objective
Pascal iOS app.<P>
<IMG src="ObjP_Part4-2.jpg" hspace="10" border="1" /><P>

Here are some notes about several of the build steps shown in the log.<P>

<UL>
<LI>Since the four placeholder ObjC files are listed in the target's 
Compile Sources build phase, they still get compiled and linked.<P>

<LI>Generating Test3.app.dSYM - creates a package containing the executable's
DWARF debug information; located just above the app bundle.<P>

<LI>Compiling MainWindow_iPhone.xib and MainWindow_iPad.xib - creates
MainWindow_iPhone.nib and MainWindow_iPad.nib and copies them to the 
app bundle.<P>

<LI>Run custom shell script 'Run Script' - launches Free Pascal compiler, 
which compiles, assembles and links your Pascal code, creating the executable
file in the app bundle, overwriting the ObjC executable. Since the script also 
echoes the compiler command line, you can see exactly what switches were passed 
to the compiler (click "more" at the right to expand the output).<P>

Note that even though the app is compiled against the iOS 5.0 SDK, the 
Deployment Target was set to 4.2 in Xcode, resulting in the -ios_version_min
linker switch set to 4.2.<P>

<LI>Creating Test3.app.dSYM - overwrites the ObjC executable's debug info with 
debug info from the Pascal executable. FPC can create this package with the -Xg
switch, but not with the expected name or in the expected location, so the Run 
Script uses the dsymutil command to create it.<P>
Note that we've compiled only for armv6 (as indicated in the previous
line).<P>
</UL>

<A name="NextSteps"></A><H2>Next steps</H2>

These four articles introduced quite a bit of material for two different 
platforms (OS X and iOS) and three Pascal compilers (ppc386, ppcx64, ppcarm). 
There's still a lot more to cover, but that's for future installments.<P>
