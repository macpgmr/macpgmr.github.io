<A name="Introduction"></A><H2>Introduction</H2>
These notes describe how to create a document-based Cocoa app using a custom
Pascal template. You should already have installed Xcode 4, the Free
Pascal compilers and custom templates described in 
<A HREF="ObjP_Part1.html">Part 1</A>.<P>

<H3>What is a document-based app?</H3>

Cocoa's document-based architecture solves a common problem: opening and
managing multiple documents, typically of the same type, with one instance of
an application. In a document-based app, each open document has its own
window and you can easily view multiple documents at the same time by moving
their windows around. On a Mac, you can also manage these windows in conjunction 
with Spaces if you've activated this feature in System Preferences.<P>

Windows addresses this problem with its multiple document interface (MDI)
and single document interface (SDI). In MDI there is a single window and
some way of switching between documents. In SDI each document is
in a separate window that's activated via the Taskbar and looks almost like
a separate instance of the app.<P>

Another approach popular on both platforms is to use a tabbed or indexed 
window to handle multiple documents.<P>

A "document" can contain virtually any kind of data and, when saved to disk,
can encompass one or multiple files. For example, if you think of a project 
as being a document, then both Xcode and Dashcode would be considered 
document-based, although you might lose sight of this when working <I>within</I>
a project since multiple files in the project folder can be opened at the same 
time. Delphi and Lazarus would not be considered document-based since they 
can only open one project at a time.<P>

<H3>How is a document-based app implemented?</H3>

For the purposes of this article, a document-based app is implemented via
two subclasses that are created by the supplied Pascal project template:<P>

<UL>
<LI>A subclass of <B>NSDocument</B> that knows how to read and
write the document files (once you've added your own code to do this, that is), 
but knows nothing about the app's user interface.<P>
<LI>A subclass of 
<B>NSWindowController</B> that manages the window used to display 
the document's data and serves as the window's delegate; this subclass 
knows nothing about how the document is stored.<P>
</UL>

For more information, see Apple's extensive overview of Cocoa's document-based 
architecture <A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Documents/Documents.html%23//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000006i">here</A>.<P>

By splitting the "controller layer" into a "model controller" (NSDocument)
and a "view controller" (NSWindowController), we ensure that the user interface
doesn't get tangled up with the underlying document and provides a way that
either subclass can be recycled in other apps with minimal changes.<P>

Note that you can create a document-based Cocoa app by subclassing only
NSDocument. However, Apple's overview suggests that dividing the 
responsibilities into two subclasses is the recommended approach "for all but the
simplest cases." Interestingly, the Objective C template included with Xcode 4
does not do this, a case where Apple seems to be ignoring its own advice. But
not to worry: the Pascal template automatically creates both subclasses
so you don't have to do this manually.<P>

It's also possible to have a third "mediating" controller that sits between
the model and view controllers, but that's beyond the scope of this article.<P>

<HR>

<A name="YourFirstDocBasedApp"></A><H2>Your first document-based Cocoa app</H2>

Start Xcode and choose File | New | New Project. Under Mac OS X you should see
Objective Pascal (if not, you probably don't have the templates installed
in the correct location). Click Objective Pascal and select the Document-Based
Cocoa Application template, then click Next and enter the following:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Product Name - enter <B>Test2</B> for this example project.<P>

<LI>Document Class - the will be the name of your NSDocument subclass;
for this example, enter <B>MyDocument</B>.<P>

<LI>Document Extension - enter the file extension used with your document files;
files with this extension will be automatically associated with your app
so you can just double-click one in Finder to open it with your app; for this
example, just enter <B>mydoc1</B> (don't include a leading dot).<P>

<LI>Window Controller Class - this will be the name of your NSWindowController
subclass; for this example, enter <B>MyWindowController</B>.<P>
</UL>

Now click Next and navigate to where you want to save the files that will be 
created. For example, if you navigate to /Users/yourname/Documents and you 
entered <B>Test2</B> for your project name, Xcode will create a folder named Test2 
under Documents. Inside this folder it will create two additional folders, 
named Test2 (for your app's files) and Test2.xcodeproj (for its project files).<P>

Several of the files that the template creates are the same as in Part 1, 
but there are some differences, as noted below.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 2-1. A document-based app's files.<P>
<IMG src="ObjP_Part2-1.jpg" hspace="10" align="left" /><P>
ReadMe.txt - brief getting-started instructions for the new project.<P>

MainMenu.xib - in Part 1 this file contained both the main menu and the main 
window; in a document-based app, this file contains only the menu.<P>

MyDocument.xib - since multiple documents can be opened, each in its own
window, the window layout is now in its own file, which is loaded
each time a document is opened.<P>

.h / .m files - Objective C placeholder files for creating connections; you
make a connection by dragging a control's Outlet or Action to the
MyWindowController.h header file.<P>

Test2.pas - Pascal program file; same as in Part 1.<P>

MyWindowControllerU.pas - Pascal window controller class.<P>

MyDocumentU.pas - Pascal document class.<P>

<BR clear="all"><P>

You can go ahead and compile and run your app (Product | Run), although it 
doesn't really do anything yet.<P>

<HR>

<A name="AddingCodeToDoc"></A><H2>Adding code to the document class</H2>

Let's start with the document class since the changes we'll make there will
be all code and no UI. Click on MyDocumentU.pas and look at the code that the
template created. It should look like the figure below (as viewed in
TextWrangler).<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 2-2. The default Pascal document class.<P>
<IMG src="ObjP_Part2-2.jpg" hspace="10" /><P>

Our document subclass overrides five NSDocument methods. For more
information on the NSDocument class, refer to Apple's documentation 
<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSDocument_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004035">here</A>.
Note that although NSDocument is part of AppKit, it's a subclass of the root
NSObject class.<P>

<UL>
<LI>init - when used along with the alloc method, this is roughly analogous to
the Object Pascal Create constructor.<P>

<LI>dealloc - this is roughly analogous to the Object Pascal Destroy destructor.<P>

<LI>makeWindowControllers - the only thing our document class knows about the
UI is that it's managed by a class named MyWindowController, so it creates
the window controller and adds it to the controller array (a document
could have multiple windows, although not in this example). Note that 
MyWindowControllerU is in the uses statement so we have access to
the MyWindowController class declaration.<P>

<LI>writeToURL_ofType_error - writes the document's data to a file, returning
True if successful or False and an error if unsuccessful.<P>

<LI>readFromURL_ofType_error - reads the document's data from a file, returning
True if successful or False and an error if unsuccessful.<P>
</UL>

So what kind of data should our document contain? Well, to keep things really
simple, let's just create XML documents that contain a single element called
"Name" where we save a name entered in the document's window. To create and
manipulate these XML files we'll use several Foundation classes, which are
documented <A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/ObjC_classic/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001091">here</A>.
You could also use the Free Pascal XML units DOM and XmlRead but that's beyond
the scope of this article.<P>

Now add two additional methods to our document class for getting and setting
the XML Name element, as well as fill in the overridden methods. You can just
copy and paste the code from below into your own MyDocumentU.pas file using 
Xcode's code editor or an editor such as TextWrangler. The lines you need 
to add are highlighted in <B>bold</B>.<P>

end;</B>

end.
</PRE>

The overridden init method now creates an XML object containing the minimum
XML needed for a new document, for example for use with a new document that was
not loaded from a file. This XML object is freed in the dealloc method.<P>

Note that much of the code is just error checking. It should be self-explanatory
once you've familiarized yourself with the classes involved (NSXMLDocument,
NSError, NSData, NSArray and NSXMLNode).<P>

So now we have our document class, which can create, read and write our simple
XML document files on demand as well as get and set a document's data.<P>

<HR>

<A name="AddingUI"></A><H2>Adding UI elements and window controller code</H2>

Let's turn our attention to the app's user interface.<P>

Click MyDocument.xib in Xcode's Project navigator to display the
blank window. First select and delete the dummy "Your document contents 
here" control. Then drag and drop a Text Field onto the window (review Part 1
if necessary). Now do two things:<P>

<OL>
<LI>Click the New Referencing Outlet's circle for the Text Field, then drag 
and drop it where indicated in the ObjC MyWindowController.h file. Xcode will 
prompt you for a name - enter "nameTextField".<P>

<LI>Click the delegate's circle for the Text Field, then drag and drop it
on File's Owner (blue cube). MyWindowController is the owner of the .xib file
(deployed as .nib), so this means that the window controller will 
also serve as the Text Field's delegate.<P>
</OL>

Now click on MyWindowControllerU.pas and look at the code that the template 
created. It should look like the figure below (as viewed in TextWrangler).<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 2-4. The default Pascal window controller class.<P>
<IMG src="ObjP_Part2-4.jpg" hspace="10" /><P>

As with the document subclass, our window controller subclass overrides 
several methods. For more information on the NSWindowController class, 
refer to Apple's documentation 
<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSWindowController_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004152">here</A>.<P>

The windowDidLoad method is called after the document is loaded, 
so we can add any custom UI code there for setting up the window.<P>

Now add the Text Field's outlet declaration, one additional method, and a line 
of setup code to windowDidLoad. The code should now look like this, with the new 
lines in <B>bold</B>.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 2-5. The finished Pascal window controller class.<P>
<PRE>
unit MyWindowControllerU;

{$modeswitch ObjectiveC1}

interface

uses
  CocoaAll;

type
  MyWindowController = objcclass(NSWindowController)
     {IBOutlets}
<B>    nameTextField : NSTextField;</B>

     {IBActions}

  public
    function init : id; override;
    procedure dealloc; override;
    procedure windowDidLoad; override;
<B>    function control_textShouldEndEditing(control: NSControl; fieldEditor: NSText): Boolean; 
              message 'control:textShouldEndEditing:';</B>
  end;


implementation

uses
  MyDocumentU;

function MyWindowController.init : id;
begin
  Result := initWithWindowNibName(NSSTR('MyDocument'));
end;

procedure MyWindowController.dealloc;
begin
  inherited dealloc;
end;

procedure MyWindowController.windowDidLoad;
begin
  inherited windowDidLoad;
<B>  nameTextField.setStringValue(MyDocument(document).getName);</B>
end;

<B>function MyWindowController.control_textShouldEndEditing(control: NSControl; fieldEditor: NSText): Boolean;
begin
  MyDocument(document).setName(fieldEditor.string_);
  Result := True;
end;</B>

end.
</PRE>

A few notes and tips on this code:<P>

<UL>
<LI>To save yourself some typing when you need to add a method with a long name, 
you can just copy and paste it from the parsed Cocoa header files included with
Free Pascal. For example, control_textShouldEndEditing is part of the protocol 
that you can implement in the delegate class for any NSControl subclass such as 
NSTextField (remember, MyWindowController is nameTextField's delegate). 
In this case, you can just copy and paste the method declaration from the 
NSControl.inc file. And where are these parsed header files? With FPC 2.6.0, 
the AppKit files are here:<P>

<PRE>
/Developer/FreePascalCompiler/2.6.0/Source/packages/cocoaint/src/appkit
</PRE>

The Foundation files are here:<P>

<PRE>
/Developer/FreePascalCompiler/2.6.0/Source/packages/cocoaint/src/foundation
</PRE>

<LI>You don't have to use the indicated method name as long as its message
is correct, although there's probably some benefit to using the default
method name for consistency. Note that the number of colons in the message 
is equal to the number of parameters in the method.<P>

<LI>The MyDocumentU unit is in the implementation section's uses statement 
rather than the interface uses to avoid circular references. We include it 
so we can cast NSWindowController.document, which is just an untyped id, 
to MyDocument.<P>

<LI>An underscore was added to the parsed headers for NSText's string method 
name since <I>string</I> is a reserved word in Pascal.<P>

</UL>

Now compile and run the app. You should be able to create, save and open
files of type .mydoc1, enter a name to save (press Return or Tab to trigger
control_textShouldEndEditing), double-click a file in Finder to open it in 
the app, etc.<P>

<HR>

<A name="NextSteps"></A><H2>Next steps</H2>

If you followed the brief tutorial above, you will have created an actual 
document-based Cocoa app, writing only a few dozen lines of Pascal code, all 
done in Xcode 4 (with the possible exception of using an external code editor). 
You should also have a basic feel for several important Cocoa classes.<P>

It's hard to overstate how much you get "for free" via the Pascal template and 
the underlying Cocoa functionality. As an exercise, try implementing a similar
app on any other platform using any other tool.<P>

Note the number of menu commands in the app's menus. Some of these are not
yet implemented. To extend this app, you could try adding the following:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Printing - you'll probably need to override NSDocument's 
printOperationWithSettings_error method.<P>

<LI>Revert - see the NSDocument documentation for more information.<P>

<LI>Call control_textShouldEndEditing in more places so you don't have
to press Return or Tab.<P>
</UL>

Don't forget that an Objective Pascal Xcode project also has an escape hatch or 
fallback position that protects some of your investment in the project. For 
example, if you decide at some point that you want to develop your app in 
Objective C instead, all you have to do is delete the Run Script from your target's 
Build Phases and you've reverted to an ObjC project. You can continue using 
the project itself, the .xib files you've created, the ObjC .h and .m files, 
and all of the supporting files. Knowing that you have this "out" is also a good
argument for starting with ObjP instead of ObjC in the first place.<P>
