<A name="Introduction"></A><H2>Introduction</H2>

Many iOS native apps can be thought of as Web apps, although of the 
out-of-browser variety. Look at the standard apps included with iOS: 
Mail, Stocks, Weather, etc. - they all need an Internet connection
to show up-to-date information. But unlike in-browser Web apps,
they look and feel great (more responsive, better transitions) and 
often have limited functionality even when off-line.<P>

These notes describe how to add support to your iOS app for retrieving
Internet data via a Web service using the cross-platform, open-source 
Web Service Toolkit.<P>

<HR>
<A name="Requirements"></A><H2>Requirements</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Free Pascal compilers for i386 and ARM. Installers for FPC 2.6.2 can be
downloaded from <A HREF="ftp://freepascal.stack.nl/pub/fpc/dist/2.6.2/i386-macosx/">here</A>.<P>

<LI>Web Service Toolkit source - can be checked out with command-line SVN or 
a Subversion frontend like <A HREF="http://www.versionsapp.com">Versions</A> or 
<A HREF="http://www.zennaware.com">Cornerstone</A>. For example, open a Terminal 
window, change to a directory where you want to check out the WST source,
and enter:<P>

<PRE>
svn co https://lazarus-ccr.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/lazarus-ccr/wst/trunk .
</PRE>

Documentation is here:  <A HREF="http://wiki.freepascal.org/Web_Service_Toolkit">http://wiki.freepascal.org/Web_Service_Toolkit</A>
</UL>

<HR>
<A name="ParsingWSDL"></A><H2>Parsing the WSDL file</H2>

First compile the WST's <B>ws_helper</B> program. Open a Terminal window and 
change to the ws_helper subdirectory in your WST checkout, then enter the 
following (or put it in a script file):

<PRE>
fpc -Cirot -Fi../ -Fu../ -Fu../wst_rtti_filter -dWST_HANDLE_DOC ws_helper.pas
</PRE>

Next parse the WSDL file for the Web service you want to use. For this example,
we'll use a WSDL file from the U.S. National Weather Service. Download file
<B>ndfdXML.wsdl</B> from this site:<P>

<A HREF="http://www.usgovxml.com/DataService.aspx?ds=NDFD">http://www.usgovxml.com/DataService.aspx?ds=NDFD</A>.<P>

Parse ndfdXML.wsdl by entering the following all on one line (or put it
in a script):<P>

<PRE>
ws_helper -uA -p -o. -fhttp_graphical_weather_gov_xml_DWMLgen_schema_DWML_xsd=ndfdDWML_schema ndfdXML.wsdl
</PRE>

For more information about the various switches used, run ws_helper without any
switches. The one switch that might require some explanation is the -f switch. 
It's used so that the name of one of the generated units is shortened to just 
ndfdDWML_schema.<P>

With ndfdXML.wsdl, the ws_helper parser generates these files that you'll use
along with the WST units:<P>

<PRE>
  ndfdXML.pas
  ndfdXML.wst
  ndfdXML_proxy.pas
  ndfdDWML_schema.pas
</PRE>

<HR>
<A name="Testing"></A><H2>Testing the Web service</H2>

Web Service Toolkit can be used with any of these HTTP libraries:<P>

<PRE>
  Indy
  Synapse
  ICS
  FPC's HTTP client
  Foundation framework-based HTTP client (for iOS)
</PRE>

WST includes an xxxx_http_protocol.pas file for each library that implements two 
library-specific classes required by WST. You use the appropriate protocol unit 
along with the units generated from the Web service's WSDL file to call the 
Web service from your app.<P>

To test on iOS, we'll use the NDFD Web service to retrieve a 5-day weather 
forecast for 
<A HREF="http://www.city-data.com/city/Silverton-Colorado.html">Silverton, Colorado</A>, 
a town in the Rocky Mountains that generally has fairly 
cool nighttime temperatures because of its elevation (9,305 feet, or about
2,835 meters).<P>

Create an iOS Pascal project in Xcode, then do the following:<P>

<OL>
<LI>Copy the four ndfd files created by ws_helper into the project's source
folder, or add their location to FPC's unit search path with the -Fu switch
(if you created your app with the Xcode Pascal template, you can add -Fu 
to the FPC_COMMON build setting).<P>

<LI>Download the two iOS HTTP client files 
(<A HREF="ns_url_request.pas">ns_url_request.pas</A>
and <A HREF="NSHelpers.pas">NSHelpers.pas</A>),
then copy them into the project's source folder or add their location
to FPC's unit search path with the -Fu switch.<P>

<LI>Add the location of the WST checkout to FPC's unit search path 
with the -Fu switch.<P>

<LI>Add these units to your app's uses statement:<P>
<PRE>
SysUtils,
DateUtils,
ns_http_protocol,  //WST units
soap_formatter,
base_service_intf,
ndfdXML,  //Web service units
ndfdXML_proxy,
ndfdDWML_schema
</PRE>

<LI>Add the following code to your app's startup code (for example, in 
application_didFinishLaunchingWithOptions) or to an action receiving method
or event handler. Note that all we're doing at 
this point is testing the Web service, so we'll just dump the
retrieved XML to the Xcode debug window so we can see what's returned
by the Web service.
<PRE>
var
  NdfdService : ndfdXMLPortType;
  Latitude    : Double;
  Longitude   : Double;
  NumDays     : Integer;  
  StartDate   : TDateRemotable;
  UnitsToUse  : ndfdDWML_schema.unitType;
begin
  NS_RegisterHTTP_Transport;
  try
    NdfdService := wst_CreateInstance_ndfdXMLPortType;
    if not Assigned(NdfdService) then
      WriteLn('Unable to connect to NDFD Web service.')
    else
      begin
      Latitude := 37.81;  //Silverton, CO's lat/long
      Longitude := -107.66;
      NumDays := 5;
      StartDate := TDateRemotable.Create;
      StartDate.AsDate := Today;
      UnitsToUse := ndfdDWML_schema.e;  //use ndfdDWML_schema.m for metric
      try
        WriteLn(NdfdService.NDFDgenByDay(Latitude, Longitude, 
                                         StartDate, NumDays, UnitsToUse, 
                                         formatType__24_hourly));
      finally
        StartDate.Free;
        end;
      end;
  except on E:Exception do
    WriteLn(E.Message);
  end;
</PRE>

<LI>Now run your app and look at the XML dumped to the debug window (if you
don't see the debug window, choose View | Debug Area | Show Debug Area).
You can also see the output in the Log navigator's debug log. Scroll down
to the forecast's maximum/minimum temperatures, then check to see that they're
close to what a reputable weather site gives (for example
<A HREF="http://classic.wunderground.com/cgi-bin/findweather/hdfForecast?query=silverton%2Cco&searchType=WEATHER">Weather Underground</A>).

<A name="CrossPlatform"></A><H2>Making the code cross-platform</H2>

Since WST is cross-platform, it makes sense to write your code to be
cross-platform too, even if you're currently interested only in iOS.
That way you can effortlessly recycle your code if you target other
platforms in the future. Here are three areas to focus on.<P>

<H3>Separating WST-related code from the UI</H3>

In the code fragment above, the WriteLn calls are only placeholders for use
in testing. In an actual app, you would present any error message or the
results of a Web service call in the app's user interface. But you would not
mix non-UI code like Web service calls with UI code that does the presentation 
of the results of those calls. Instead, you should pass back the error message 
or results to the calling code without regard to what the calling code
ultimately does with it - that way your non-UI code can be used in a 
console app, Web app, DLL, etc. as well as in a desktop or mobile app, 
regardless of how the app's user interface is implemented (it may not even
have a user interface).<P>

Naturally that means moving the WST-related code into its own unit and either
wrapping it in a class or in a series of functions. In no case should this unit
include VCL/LCL units like Forms, Dialogs, Controls, etc. in its uses
statement.<P>

The same goes for inputs to your WST-related code. For example, with the NDFD
Web service, you would probably pass in the latitude and longitude rather
than hard-wiring it the way we did for testing purposes. The NDFD Web service
also provides methods for retrieving lat/long values for cities, zip codes,
etc. You could wrap up these methods in a similar fashion.

<H3>Supporting multiple HTTP libraries</H3>

First decide what HTTP libraries you're going to use. For example, you might 
decide like this:<P>

<UL>
<LI>With FPC, use its HTTP client for all platforms except iOS.
<LI>With iOS, use the Foundation-based HTTP client.
<LI>With Delphi on Windows, use Indy.
</UL>

To handle these libraries conditionally, change your uses statement so it
includes something like this:<P>

<PRE>
{$IFDEF FPC}
 {$IF DEFINED(IPHONESIM) OR (DEFINED(DARWIN) AND DEFINED(CPUARM))}  {iOS?}
  ns_http_protocol,
 {$ELSE}
  fpc_http_protocol,
 {$IFEND}
{$ELSE}  {Delphi}
  delphi_init_com,
  indy_http_protocol,
{$ENDIF}
</PRE>

Register the libraries conditionally in a similar fashion:<P>

<PRE>
{$IFDEF FPC}
 {$IF DEFINED(IPHONESIM) OR (DEFINED(DARWIN) AND DEFINED(CPUARM))}
  NS_RegisterHTTP_Transport;
 {$ELSE}
  FPC_RegisterHTTP_Transport;
 {$IFEND}
{$ELSE}
  INDY_RegisterHTTP_Transport;
{$ENDIF}  
</PRE>

That's all you need to do. The rest of your WST-related code will be the same 
for all platforms.<P>

<H3>Processing XML returned by the Web service</H3>

Many Web services, including NDFD, return data as XML, so you'll need to 
process this XML to find the data you need. Unfortunately the Free Pascal and
Delphi XML units are not compatible, so you may need to write
this code twice, once for Free Pascal and once for Delphi. For example, 
with Free Pascal you would use the XMLRead and DOM units, with Delphi you
would use the XMLIntf and XMLDoc units. You could also develop
a wrapper unit for both that conditionally compiles the appropriate code
depending on compiler used.<P>

Note that the NDFD methods return XML in a string. You could write
this string to a temporary file, passing this file name back to the calling
code, which then passes it on to your XML processing code. You could also
write the XML string to a stream and pass the stream object back to the 
calling code. You can load either a file or a stream with the Free Pascal
and Delphi XML parsers.<P>
