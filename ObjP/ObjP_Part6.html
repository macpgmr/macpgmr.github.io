<A name="Introduction"></A><H2>Introduction</H2>
In many ways, OS X has more in common with Windows than iOS has with either.
These notes describe some of the ways that iOS differs from a desktop operating
system and how you can address some of those differences when programming in 
Pascal.<P>

<B><I>Tip:</I></B> If you've never developed for OS X or iOS before, you may
find the previous articles in this series helpful. The complete list of 
articles is <A HREF="ObjP_Intro.html">here</A>. You can ignore most of the 
discussion of designing the user interface in Xcode since you'll be doing that 
in Delphi as usual.<P>

<HR>

<A name="Doesn't Have"></A><H2>Doesn't Have</H2>

Here's a list of some things that you will <I>not</I> find on iOS:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Menus.
<LI>User interaction with a precise pointing device like a mouse.
<LI>Tab or Esc keys.
<LI>Dialog boxes. Instead, what you see on the screen is replaced by another
"view", usually as the result of a touch event.
<LI>Common dialogs. The closest you'll get is an alert box that you can 
use to display error messages. On Windows and OS X, common dialogs are used
to select files and similar file system activities. In many iOS apps, users 
do not perceive that they are working with "files" - instead, they pick from
items that may happen to correspond to files.
<LI>One-size-fits-all user interface. If you're creating a "universal app"
that targets both iPhone and iPad, you will almost certainly want to design
two different user interfaces.
<LI>Apps that include external libraries; all of an app's code must be linked into
a single executable file.
<LI>Windows-like registry.
</UL>

<HR>

<A name="Does Have"></A><H2>Does Have</H2>

Here's a list of some things that you <I>will</I> find on iOS:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Standard Unix file system. However, there are some things about it worth noting:
  <UL>
  <LI>Case-sensitive file system like Linux, unlike OS X and Windows. Pay 
      attention to this in <I>uses</I> statements too - this will help
      prepare you for Android and Linux when they come along.
  <LI>The separator character in file paths is the forward slash like on OS X 
      and Linux, but if you're using a standard RTL function instead of a string 
      literal in forming paths, that won't be a problem.
  <LI>"Sandboxed" apps. For more information, see <A HREF="ObjP_Part5.html#The Sandbox">Part 5</A>.
  </UL>
<LI>Code-signed apps. You can "code-sign" an application on just about any
platform, but on iOS it's required for installing an app on an iOS device.
It also involves downloading a provisioning profile for your app from 
Apple's developer site. For more information, see <A HREF="ObjP_Part4.html#ProvisioningProfile">Part 4</A>.
<LI>Extensive <A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/technologies/ios/cocoa-touch.html">libraries</A> 
for user interface, networking, data and more.
<LI>Familiar <A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/technologies/ios/graphics-and-animation.html">libraries</A> 
like OpenGL for graphics, animation and more. (It appears as though everything
on iOS is drawn using OpenGL, making iOS animation <A HREF="http://nfarina.com/post/8239634061/ios-to-android">"hopelessly fast"</A>
compared to Android according to one experienced developer.)
</UL>

<HR>

<A name="iOS Simulator"></A><H2>iOS Simulator</H2>

You'll need a Mac to develop for iOS, but you do not need an actual iOS device
to get started since Xcode includes iOS Simulator that you can use
to simulate various iOS devices and versions.<P>

Remember that iOS Simulator is a <I>simulator</I>, not an <I>emulator</I>. 
It does not emulate the ARM instruction set, but rather executes apps that have 
been compiled for x86 just like normal OS X apps. These apps are linked against
x86 versions of the iOS frameworks rather than against ARM versions.<P>

As a result, how an app operates under the Simulator can differ from how it
operates on an actual device. This means you need to test on an actual
device before deploying your app or submitting it to the App Store. However,
the benefit of a simulator is speed - if you've ever developed for Android, 
you know that the Android emulator is almost useless because it's so slow.<P>

Here are some things to watch out for when using the Simulator:

<UL>
<LI>If you forget that iOS has a case-sensitive file system, your app may run
fine under the Simulator, but not on an iOS device.
<LI>An app running under the Simulator is using the full power of the Mac's
Intel processor. It may run much slower on an iOS device.
<LI>Although tiny, an iOS device has hardware that you probably won't have
on your Mac, including phone, accelerometer, GPS, camera, etc. It's hard
to simulate these things - another reason why testing on an actual device
is essential.
<LI>An app running under the Simulator is not sandboxed or code-signed the
way it is on an iOS device, so you can do things that don't make sense or
are not permitted on an actual device. For example, you can move files in and 
out of your app's home directory under the Simulator using Finder, pretty much
like a normal OS X app. On an iOS device, much of this access is restricted
or indirect. For more information, see <A HREF="ObjP_Part5.html#Sharing Files">Part 5</A>.
</UL>

<HR>

<A name="Pascal Language"></A><H2>Pascal Language</H2>

Because you'll be using Free Pascal with Delphi XE2 to compile for both 
iOS Simulator and iOS devices, be aware that there are a few differences 
in language features between Free Pascal and Delphi. In general, these are 
either newish Delphi language features not yet supported by Free Pascal or 
somewhat esoteric features that you might not even have known about, much 
less ever used.<P>

Here's a list of features not yet supported in the current stable version
of Free Pascal (2.4.4):<P>

<A HREF="http://wiki.freepascal.org/delphi_language_features_which_fpc_does_not_have">http://wiki.freepascal.org/delphi_language_features_which_fpc_does_not_have</A><P>

However, since presumably you'll be using version 2.5.1, some of these 
features should be available, as described here:<P>

<A HREF="http://wiki.freepascal.org/FPC_New_Features_Trunk">http://wiki.freepascal.org/FPC_New_Features_Trunk</A><P>

Free Pascal supports UnicodeString, but <I>string</I> is still AnsiString.
WideString is also available.<P>

<H3>Objective Pascal</H3>

Free Pascal 2.5.1 supports an optional syntax extension that allows you to
work with Objective C classes in Pascal on OS X and iOS. The primary use for this
is to work with Objective C frameworks such as <B>Foundation</B> directly in Pascal. 
For example, you might want to use the Foundation framework's NSString class, which 
fully supports Unicode. More information about Objective Pascal is here:<P>

<A HREF="http://wiki.freepascal.org/FPC_PasCocoa">http://wiki.freepascal.org/FPC_PasCocoa</A><P>

A list of Objective C classes available with the Foundation framework on iOS is
<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/ObjC_classic/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001091">here</A>.

<HR>

<A name="Runtime Library"></A><H2>Runtime Library (RTL)</H2>

You may not need to use the Objective C frameworks much for basic tasks. The 
units included with Free Pascal and Delphi should insulate you from much of the 
underlying system. To start, Free Pascal includes many of the standard non-UI 
<A HREF="http://www.freepascal.org/docs.var">runtime units</A> 
that you use in any Delphi application, including the following:<P>

<UL>
<LI>System
<LI>SysUtils
<LI>Classes
<LI>Variants
<LI>DateUtils
<LI>Math
</UL>

You use these units the same as you do in Delphi and they should work on iOS 
the same as they do on Windows.<P>

Presumably Delphi XE2 will include the <B>IOUtils</B> unit for iOS. This unit should 
make working with some aspects of the iOS file system easier. For example,
to obtain the path to your app's temporary directory (<I>tmp</I> in the app's
home directory), in Objective C you would use the Foundation framework's
NSTemporaryDirectory function, as illustrated in this snippet of Objective 
Pascal code:<P>

<PRE>
  var
    tmpDir : NSString;
  begin
    tmpDir := NSTemporaryDirectory;
</PRE>

To use tmpDir with the Pascal RTL, you would first need to convert it to
an AnsiString. Part 5 introduced the <A HREF="NSHelpers.pas">NSHelpers</A> unit 
that provides some basic string conversion routines for doing just that. 
However, if we assume the presence of the IOUtils unit, then presumably you 
could just do this instead:<P>

<PRE>
  var
    tmpDir : string;
  begin
    tmpDir := TPath.GetTempPath;
</PRE>

More problematic is obtaining the path to your app's Documents directory. In
Objective Pascal, you would use a somewhat awkward construction like this:<P>

<PRE>
  var
    paths  : NSArray;
    docDir : NSString;
  begin
    paths := NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, True);
    docDir := paths.objectAtIndex(0);
</PRE>

So what's the RTL equivalent? Well, presumably you <I>could</I> do something 
like this using IOUtils, although this code assumes both the name and relative 
location of the Documents subdirectory within the app home directory:

<PRE>
  var
    docDir : string;
  begin
    docDir := TPath.GetHomePath + TPath.DirectorySeparatorChar + 'Documents';
</PRE>

In some cases you may be forced to use the Foundation framework if a Pascal
RTL equivalent is not provided. For example, an iOS app's home directory includes
a Preferences subdirectory. You never write directly to Preferences, though. 
Instead you use the <A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSUserDefaults_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003764">NSUserDefaults</A>
class to read and write user preferences and to save and restore your app's state.
You can also use the <B>CFPreferences</B> unit, since this calls a C library 
in the older <A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/CoreFoundation/Reference/CoreFoundation_Collection/_index.html">
<I>Core</I>Foundation</A> framework and doesn't require Objective C.
(The Foundation framework is mostly Objective C wrappers around
CoreFoundation functions - that is, Foundation turns these C functions into
Objective C classes.)<P>

<HR>

<A name="Free Component Library"></A><H2>Free Component Library (FCL)</H2>

Free Pascal includes an extensive collection of additional units known as the
<A HREF="http://www.freepascal.org/docs.var">Free Component Library</A> (FCL). 
Many of these units have no counterpart in 
Delphi's standard units and, where they do, they're generally not compatible
with Delphi's. If you use any of these units, you'll probably be tying your
code, or at least a portion of it, to Free Pascal. With that in mind, however,
you may find some of these units to be extremely useful, particularly on 
iOS. And it may also encourage you to divide your code into units
that can easily be swapped out on other platforms.<P>

For example, FCL includes units for working with XML files in a normal 
tree-oriented DOM fashion. The Objective C Foundation framework includes the 
<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSXMLParser_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003773">NSXMLParser</A>
class, but this is an event-drive parser, designed for speed and 
minimal memory use, and you may not find it very useful. However, if you use 
the FCL XML units, you won't be able to compile your XML-handling code with 
Delphi.<P>

For example, to load an XML file with the FCL XML units, you might do 
something like this:<P>

<PRE>
  var
    XmlDoc : TXMLDocument;
  begin
    ReadXmlFile(XmlDoc, FileName);
</PRE>

In contrast, with Delphi you might write it like this:<P>

<PRE>
  var
    XmlDoc : IXMLDocument;
  begin
    XmlDoc := TXMLDocument.Create(nil);
    XmlDoc.FileName := FileName;
</PRE>

FCL also includes units for working with <A HREF="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</A>
databases. Every Mac and iOS device includes the SQLite library and since it's 
a normal C library, you don't need Objective C to use it, just the FCL <B>sqlite3</B> 
and <B>SQLite3db</B> units.<P>

For example, if your iOS app included a SQLite version of the FishFact database, 
you could open and query it like this:<P>

<PRE>
  var
    DbFileName : string;
    SqliteDb   : TSQLite;
    FishName   : string;
    QryResult  : TStringList;
  begin
    DbFileName := 'biolife.sqlitedb';  //add appropriate path
    SqliteDb := TSQLite.Create(DbFileName);
    try  //assuming SqliteDb.LastError=SQLITE_OK
      FishName := 'Clown Triggerfish';
      QryResult := TStringList.Create;
      if SqliteDb.Query('SELECT "Species Name" FROM BIOLIFE WHERE Common_Name = "' +
                        FishName + '";', QryResult) then
        begin
        // do something with QryResult.Strings[1]
        end;
    finally
      QryResult.Free;
      SqliteDb.Free;
      end;
</PRE>

<A name="Xcode Way vs. Delphi Way"></A><H2>The Xcode Way vs. the Delphi Way</H2>

The gold standard for iOS development is Xcode, 
<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Introduction/introObjectiveC.html">Objective C</A>,
and direct use of <A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/technologies/ios/cocoa-touch.html">Cocoa Touch</A>
frameworks. However, many Delphi developers are likely to find this approach alien, 
if not downright repellent, particularly when designing an app's user interface.<P>

Parts 1-5 of this series present an approach that substitutes Objective Pascal
for Objective C, but otherwise uses Xcode and Cocoa Touch in essentially the
same way as they are used in Objective C development. However, because Pascal
is not integrated into the Xcode IDE, this approach requires some fairly 
awkward compromises. For example, since the only way to wire "connections"
between the user interface layout and code in Xcode is via Objective C header 
files, an Objective Pascal Xcode project requires "placeholder" Objective C 
files which are not otherwise needed.<P>

Delphi XE2 would appear to provide a reasonable "third way", moving user
interface design and code editing out of Xcode (and off the Mac entirely)
and into a Windows-hosted IDE that Delphi developers should find familiar,
relegating Xcode to the final build step. To be sure, this approach comes 
with its own bit of awkwardness (flipping between Windows and OS X), but
provides cross-platform opportunities that would not be possible with an
Xcode-only approach.<P>

However, there are some things that will probably require Xcode or direct
access to Objective C frameworks. These range from the straightforward
to the complex and the question is whether and how Delphi itself will
address them.<P>

For example, on both OS X and iOS, an app's 
<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009247">Info.plist</A> 
file controls many aspects of the app's behavior and is used to set the app's
version, copyright statement, file associations, etc. While this is just
an XML file, using the Xcode property list editor to set these things (rather
than doing it on the Delphi side) would seem logical. One small 
example: To include a custom font file with an iOS app, you just add
the name of the font to the UIAppFonts array in the Info.plist file
and add the font .ttf file to your Xcode project. When Xcode builds your
app, it will copy the font file into the app bundle automatically.
It would seem rather pointless to duplicate this iOS-specific setting
in a Windows-hosted IDE where it has no cross-platform correspondence.<P>

A bigger challenge is accessing device-specific functionality. Will this be
done via the iOS Objective C frameworks (perhaps accessed via Objective Pascal
syntax) or in a cross-platform way? <A HREF="http://www.phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</A> 
shows that a great deal of mobile functionality can be supported in a
cross-platform fashion, even for <A HREF="http://docs.phonegap.com/">JavaScript</A>, 
so perhaps a cross-platform library for mobile will emerge eventually for
Delphi too.<P>

For example, to add a Google map to an iOS app in Xcode, you use the
<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/MapKit/Reference/MapKit_Framework_Reference/_index.html">MapKit</A>
framework: Just drop an MKMapView onto a view, make a connection for it (in this
case, myMap), then add code like this to display the map:<P>

<PRE>
  var
    region : MKCoordinateRegion;
  begin
    region.center.latitude := myLatitude;
    region.center.longitude := myLongitude;
    region.span.latitudeDelta := 0.02;
    region.span.longitudeDelta := 0.02;
    myMap.setRegion(region);
    myMap.setMapType(MKMapTypeHybrid);
</PRE>

Most mobile platforms support mapping, so it's not hard to imagine a 
cross-platform Pascal library that supports, say, both Google and Bing
maps.<P>
