<H1>Pascal Syntax Highlighting in Xcode</H1>
<HR>

<H3>Add Objective Pascal syntax highlighting to Xcode's code editor</H3>

<PRE>
  <A HREF="XcodeObjectivePascalSyntaxColoring.zip">XcodeObjectivePascalSyntaxColoring.zip</A>
</PRE>

Download and unzip the two files in this zip file. Run the <B>objp_colors_xcode.sh</B>
script in a Terminal window. The script does 3 things:<P>

<OL>
  <LI>Backs up Xcode's DVTFoundation.xcplugindata to DVTFoundation.xcplugindata.bak
  <LI>Uses PlistBuddy to add an Objective Pascal section to DVTFoundation.xcplugindata
  <LI>Copies the <B>ObjectivePascal.xclangspec</B> file into the same folder as DVTFoundation.xcplugindata
</OL>

When you next start Xcode, you should see "Objective Pascal" in the Editor | 
Syntax Coloring menu - select this for your .pas files. If you don't, do this:<P>

In Finder, look under <B>/var/folders</B> until you find a folder named 
<B>com.apple.DeveloperTools</B>.
In this folder you'll see folders that correspond to all of the versions of 
Xcode that you've ever run on your computer. Rename or delete the current
version's folder (eg, 7.1-7B91b for Xcode 7.1). This is a cache folder and will
be recreated the next time Xcode is run. Now start Xcode and you should
see "Objective Pascal" in the Syntax Coloring menu.<P><BR>

Tip: For a better typing experience with Pascal, uncheck "Syntax-aware indenting"
in Xcode preferences (on the Text Editing | Indentation tab).<P><BR>
